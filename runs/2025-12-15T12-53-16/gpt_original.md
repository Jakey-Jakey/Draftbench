### Traits

**Arcane Power Armor.** Doom’s armor is integrated into his fighting style and spellwork:
- Doom can use the armor as a spellcasting focus, and he requires no material components for his spells.
- Doom has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws made to resist being pushed or knocked prone.
- Doom can breathe in any environment, including underwater and in a vacuum.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Master Tactician.** Doom can’t be surprised. In addition, he adds his Intelligence modifier to initiative rolls (included).

**Doombot Contingency (1/Day).** When Doom would be reduced to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point, teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see, and becomes invisible until the end of his next turn. A **doombot** (use the *helmed horror* stat block) appears in Doom’s previous space.

### Spellcasting
Doom is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save **DC 21**, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp*  
**1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*  
**2nd level (3 slots):** *hold person, mirror image, misty step*  
**3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt*  
**4th level (3 slots):** *dimension door, greater invisibility, stoneskin*  
**5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person, wall of force, teleportation circle*  
**6th level (1 slot):** *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
**7th level (1 slot):** *forcecage*  
**8th level (1 slot):** *maze*  
**9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two **Arcane Gauntlet** attacks, or he makes one **Arcane Gauntlet** attack and casts a cantrip.

**Arcane Gauntlet.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120/360 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (2d10 + 4 plus 4d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

**Technomystic Overload (Recharge 5–6).** Doom releases a force-laced lightning surge in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage plus 18 (4d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Constructs and creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the saving throw.

**Dread Monarch (Recharge 6).** Each enemy of Doom within 30 feet that can see him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of him until the end of Doom’s next turn. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

---

### Bonus Actions

**Tactical Teleport (3/Day).** Doom magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

---

### Reactions

**Runic Counterspell (3/Day).** Doom casts *counterspell* without expending a spell slot. When he does so, the spell is treated as being cast using a 5th-level spell slot.

**Arcane Deflection.** When Doom is hit by an attack, he adds +5 to his AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. If the attack still hits, Doom reduces the damage by 14 (2d6 + 7).

---

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Cantrip.** Doom casts a cantrip.  
**Gauntlet Strike.** Doom makes one **Arcane Gauntlet** attack.  
**Tactical Teleport.** Doom uses **Tactical Teleport** (if available).  
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower.  
**Activate Overload (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom uses **Technomystic Overload**, if available.

If you want, I can also provide a **Latverian Castle lair** (lair actions, regional effects, and a couple of doombot variants) to make him feel like an endgame “final arc” villain.
