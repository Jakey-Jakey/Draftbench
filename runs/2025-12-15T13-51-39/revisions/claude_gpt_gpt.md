___

***Armor of Doom.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. He is immune to disease, and he doesn’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.  
In addition, Doom reduces damage he takes from spells by 15 (after applying resistance and immunity).

***Regeneration.*** Doom regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point. If Doom takes acid damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of his next turn.

***Iron Resolve.*** Doom is immune to effects that would read his thoughts or determine whether he is lying (such as *detect thoughts* or magical truth effects), unless he allows it. In addition, Doom has advantage on saving throws against effects that would magically compel his behavior (such as *dominate person*).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ruler of Latveria.*** Doom has advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with creatures that recognize his authority or political power. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks made against him.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*  
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield*  
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, misty step*  
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*  
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, fire shield*  
5th level (3 slots): *hold monster, telekinesis, wall of force*  
6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
7th level (2 slots): *plane shift, teleport*; *forcecage* (1/day)  
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, power word stun*  
9th level (1 slot): *prismatic wall*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Plasma Bolt, or a combination of the two. He can replace one attack with a casting of a cantrip.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.  
**Disruptive Shock (1/Turn).** The first time Doom hits a creature with this attack on his turn, the target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. The target can repeat the save at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 8) force damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage.

***Disintegrator Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom fires a beam of destructive energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons two **Doombots** (see below) in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet of himself. The Doombots act on the initiative count immediately after Doom (taking their turns consecutively), obey his commands, and vanish after 1 hour or when destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** Doom activates his personal force field for 1 minute. While it is active, Doom gains 60 temporary hit points and has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. In addition, his speed is halved, and he can’t fly. The force field ends early if these temporary hit points are reduced to 0.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Deflection Matrix.*** When Doom is hit by a ranged attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he can use his reaction to deflect it. He takes no damage from *magic missile*, and he reduces the damage from the triggering ranged attack by 30. If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can redirect the attack at a creature within 60 feet, using the original attack roll against the new target.

***Superior Counterspell (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see casts a spell of 3rd level or lower, Doom magically counters it. This requires no ability check and doesn’t expend a spell slot.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or casts *detect magic*.  

**Plasma Bolt (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Bolt attack.  

**Technomantic Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one nonmagical metal object or technological device he can see within 60 feet. If a creature is wearing or holding the object, it must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage and drop the object (if possible). Constructs and creatures wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on this saving throw.  

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

### Lair Actions
When fighting inside Castle Doom or another location he has prepared, Doom can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Concealed turrets target up to three creatures Doom can see within 120 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) force damage.  
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors within the lair magically seal until initiative count 20 of the next round. A sealed door can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength check or destroyed (AC 18, 50 HP, immunity to poison and psychic damage).  
- **Neural Scrambler.** Up to three creatures of Doom’s choice within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until initiative count 20 of the next round. Affected creatures can repeat the save at the end of their turn, ending the effect on themselves on a success.  
- **Teleportation Grid.** Doom and up to five willing creatures he can see within 120 feet each teleport to unoccupied spaces of Doom’s choice within the lair.

___

> ### Doombot Deception
> *At the DM’s discretion, any encounter with Doctor Doom may actually be a Doombot duplicate in disguise. When a “Doom” is reduced to 0 hit points, there is a chance (determined by the DM) that it is revealed to be a Doombot, which explodes. Each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The real Doom observes from a safe location, gaining intelligence on his foes.*

___

***Constructed Nature.*** The doombot doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Tactical Link.*** While the doombot is within 30 feet of Doom and Doom isn’t incapacitated, the doombot has advantage on attack rolls.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The doombot makes two Slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning damage.

***Plasma Emitter.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) force damage.

### Reactions

***Interpose.*** When a creature the doombot can see targets Doom with an attack and the doombot is within 5 feet of Doom, the doombot imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.
