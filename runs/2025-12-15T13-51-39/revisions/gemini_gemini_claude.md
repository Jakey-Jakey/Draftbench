***Arcane Technology.*** Doom's armor serves as an arcane focus. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts, as well as all divination spells. This trait functions as if Doom were under the effect of a *mind blank* spell at all times.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
- 5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift*
- 8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
- 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombots (Recharge 6).*** Doom summons 1d3 Doombots (use **Helmed Horror** statistics) to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. A Doombot acts on Doom's initiative count. When a Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell, Doom can attempt to absorb the magic. As a reaction, he casts *counterspell* (using a 3rd level slot unless he chooses to expend a higher one). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell countered.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells.
- **Vector Trap (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a pocket dimension (as per the *banishment* spell, no concentration required) until the end of Doom's next turn.
