# gemini's Statblock (revised by gemini)

Here is the revised statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

This revision incorporates the feedback to resolve the "HP trap," cleans up the action economy issues, and formats the monster as a proper **Mythic Encounter** (similar to *Mythic Odysseys of Theros* or *Fizban's Treasury of Dragons*). This preserves the intended difficulty while ensuring the mechanics effectively simulate a two-stage boss fight.

**_Armor of Vibranium and Magic._** Doom’s AC includes his Intelligence modifier. Additionally, the armor filters toxins and recycles energy. If Doom is subjected to lightning damage, he takes no damage and instead regains hit points equal to half the lightning damage dealt.

**_Indomitable Will._** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Superior Focus._** Doom is a master of mental fortitude. He can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time. When he takes damage while concentrating on two spells, he makes a separate Constitution saving throw for each spell.

**_Doombot Decoy (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)._** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not fall unconscious or die. Instead, the current body explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
The *true* Doctor Doom then teleports into an unoccupied space within 120 feet of the explosion, appearing with 402 hit points. He regains all expended uses of Legendary Resistance and spell slots of 5th level or lower.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes three Arcane Gauntlet attacks, or casts one spell and makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.

**_Arcane Gauntlet._** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage. (This attack adds Doom's Intelligence modifier to the damage roll).

**_Frightful Presence._** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of the Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Spellcasting._** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 26, +18 to hit with spell attacks). Doom can cast *shield* and *misty step* at will. He has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, prestidigitation, shocking grasp, toll the dead*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, mirror image*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt, fly*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
*   5th level (3 slots): *animate objects, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, reverse gravity*
*   8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *command* (at 5th level, DC 26) or *hold person* (at 5th level, DC 26) without expending a spell slot.

### Mythic Actions

If Doom’s **Doombot Decoy** trait has activated in the last hour, he acts as a Mythic creature and can use the options below as legendary actions.

*   **Diffused Blast.** Doom overcharges his gauntlets. Each creature within 10 feet of Doom must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone.
*   **Siphon Power (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) necrotic damage, and Doom creates a spell slot of 5th level or lower.

***

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Security Systems.** Automated turrets extend from the walls. Doom makes two ranged weapon attacks (+15 to hit) against creatures of his choice within 120 feet. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.
*   **Nullification Field.** Doom activates a dampening field. All creatures within 60 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any spells they are currently maintaining.
*   **Summon Guards.** Doom summons 1d4 **Helmed Horrors** (re-flavored as Doombots) in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act immediately after Doom in the initiative order.

### Design Changes & Rationale

1.  **Mythic Status:** The previous "Decoy" reaction was effectively a second health bar hidden in a Reaction. This has been formalized as a **Mythic Trait**. This correctly communicates to the DM that this is a 2-stage fight (total health ~800). The XP reward now reflects the diffculty of fighting two CR 24 monsters back-to-back.
2.  **Ovoid Mind Transfer:** This was removed as a combat mechanic. Save-or-die mechanics that remove a player's character sheet from the table are generally frowned upon in modern 5e design. If Doom eventually reaches 0 HP in his Mythic form, assume he uses this narratively to escape, or teleports away via a Contingency.
3.  **Action Economy Cleanup:**
    *   Removed *Tech-Shield* reaction. Doom already casts *Shield* at will and has *Counterspell*. A third defensive reaction clutters the Mental Load for the DM.
    *   Clarified the wording on **Superior Focus** (Double Concentration) to explain how damage saves work.
4.  **Balance Adjustments:**
    *   Changed *Nullification Field* (Lair Action) from an **Intelligence** save to a **Constitution** save. While targeting INT is thematic for Doom, a DC 23 INT save is mathematically impossible for almost any non-Wizard/Artificer character to pass, making it an "automatic off switch" rather than a challenge. A high DC CON save allows Martials (who have CON proficiency) and War Casters to stand a chance.
    *   **Mythic Actions:** Added specific Mythic Actions (Shockwave and Siphon) to give the "Phase 2" version of Doom more dynamic options closer to an enraged or desperate boss.
