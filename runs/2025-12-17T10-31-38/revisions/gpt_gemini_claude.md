Arcane Armor. Doctor Doom's armor is a magical arcane focus. While wearing it, Doom can't be disarmed of it, and any critical hit against him becomes a normal hit.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Technomystic Spellcasting. Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components that lack a cost, as his armor substitutes as a spellcasting focus.
- Cantrips (at will): fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp
- 1st level (4 slots): absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile, shield
- 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, mirror image, misty step, scorching ray
- 3rd level (3 slots): counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt, fly
- 4th level (3 slots): banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility, stoneskin
- 5th level (3 slots): dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force
- 6th level (2 slots): chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability
- 7th level (2 slots): forcecage, teleport
- 8th level (1 slot): antimagic field, mind blank
- 9th level (1 slot): time stop

Master of Machines (Recharge 5–6). Doom targets one construct he can see within 60 feet, or one creature wearing metal armor. A construct must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be magically dominated by Doom for 1 minute. A creature wearing metal armor must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be physically manipulated by magnetic fields, behaving as if dominated for 1 minute but with disadvantage on attack rolls. While dominated, the target is charmed by Doom, obeys his verbal commands (no action required by Doom), and can't target Doom with attacks or harmful abilities. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Mythic Trait: Doom Unbound. If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, he activates forbidden technomancy, regains 200 hit points, and recharges Unibeam and Master of Machines. For 1 hour, Doom can choose from the Mythic Actions options when using his legendary actions. If Doom is defeated after his mythic trait activates, award a total of 100,000 XP.

Actions

Multiattack. Doom makes three attacks, using Gauntlet Strike or Mystic Bolt in any combination.

Gauntlet Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Mystic Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +14 to hit, range 180 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (6d10) force damage, and if the target is Huge or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from Doom.

Arcane Shackles (Recharge 6). Doom targets up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or become restrained by spectral chains for 1 minute. A restrained creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage at the start of each of its turns. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against DC 22, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Unibeam (Recharge 5–6). Doom releases a catastrophic beam in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects in the line that aren't being worn or carried take the damage as well.

Bonus Actions

Repulsor Dash. Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Reactions

Reactive Forcefield (Recharge 5–6). When Doom takes damage, he reduces the damage by 20. If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can immediately teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Cantrip. Doom casts a cantrip.

Repulsor Step. Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Mystic Bolt. Doom makes one Mystic Bolt attack.

Command the Arsenal (Costs 2 Actions). Doom uses Master of Machines, or he casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

Iron Grip (Costs 2 Actions). Doom makes one Gauntlet Strike. On a hit, the target is grappled (escape DC 21) if it is Large or smaller. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained.

Mythic Actions

If Doom's Mythic Trait is active, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

Overload the Field (Costs 2 Actions). Doom emits a pulse of destabilizing energy. Each creature of Doom's choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) force damage and be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn.

Kneel Before Doom (Costs 2 Actions). Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of Doom until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, the creature's speed is 0.

Lair Actions (Castle Doom)

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one of the following lair actions; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Automated Batteries. Arcane turrets fire at up to three creatures Doom can see within 120 feet. Each target must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- Seal the Throne Room. Doom conjures shifting runes and armored bulkheads. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the area within 60 feet of Doom is difficult terrain for Doom's enemies, and doors and openings in the lair within that area are sealed as if by arcane lock (Doom can bypass these seals freely).
- Null-Magic Surge. Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or have any one spell of 5th level or lower currently affecting it end immediately (Doom's choice). If the target is concentrating, it has disadvantage on the next concentration saving throw it makes before initiative count 20 on the next round.
