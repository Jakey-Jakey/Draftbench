This is an incredibly solid, high-level boss statblock. You have captured the essence of Doctor Doom perfectly: he is arrogant, frustratingly hard to pin down, and blends supreme magical ability with technological superstitions.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the statblock with constructive feedback on mechanics, balance, and design standards.

### 1. Thematic Representation
**Rating: 10/10**
You nailed the "fantasy tech" vibe. The **Doombot Contingency** is the MVP of this design; it allows Doom to "die" and escape, revealing it was a robot all along, which is arguably his most iconic narrative trope. The mix of high Intelligence, powered armor, and Force damage reflects his comic origins perfectly.

### 2. Formatting & WotC Standards
**Critique:** The statblock generally follows standard pre-*Monsters of the Multiverse* (MPMM) formatting.
**Suggestions:**
*   **Initiative:** You mention in **Master Tactician** that the initiative bonus is included. Usually, this is written in the header stats as **Initiative +8** (Dex +2, Int +6) right after Speed, rather than hidden in the text.
*   **Spellcasting Format:** WotC is moving away from giving monsters full spell slot lists (especially for combat spells) and instead putting primary attacks into the **Actions** list. However, for a super-genius Wizard like Doom, I actually prefer your current layout. It gives him versatility.
*   **Skills:** Your math on Arcana is correct (Prof +7, Int +6, Expertise +7 = +20). This is a nice detail for a supreme master of magic.

### 3. Action Economy & Reaction Bloat (Crucial Feedback)
**Issue:** Doom is suffering from severe **Reaction Competition**.
He has only **one reaction per round**, but he has four high-priority options:
1.  *Shield* (1st level spell)
2.  *Absorb Elements* (1st level spell)
3.  *Counterspell* (3rd level spell)
4.  **Runic Counterspell** (Trait)
5.  **Arcane Deflection** (Trait)

**The Conflict:** **Arcane Deflection** (+5 AC against *one* attack) is strictly worse than casting *Shield* (+5 AC against *all* attacks until his next turn), unless he is out of spell slots. Since he has plenty of slots, he will almost never use Arcane Deflection for defense.
**The Fix:**
*   **Option A (Streamline):** Remove *Shield* and *Absorb Elements* from his prepared spells. Rely entirely on **Arcane Deflection** (buff it to last until the start of his next turn, or increase the flat damage reduction).
*   **Option B (The God-King):** Change **Arcane Deflection** to not require a reaction (make it a passive trait that reduces damage), OR give him a trait called **Superior Reflexes** that allows him two reactions per round (but only one per turn).

### 4. Mechanical Balance & CR Analysis
**Target CR:** 23
**Assessment:** Accurate, perhaps leaning toward CR 24/25 defensively.

*   **Defense:** His AC is effectively 26 (21 base + *Shield/Deflection*). With +11 to +13 saving throws *and* Magic Resistance *and* Legendary Resistance, he is nearly impossible to debuff. This is appropriate for a Tier 4 boss, but be warned: players relying on Step 1: Hold Monster, Step 2: Paladin Smite will feel very useless.
*   **Offense:**
    *   **Arcane Gauntlet:** 35 avg damage.
    *   **Multiattack:** 70 damage.
    *   **Legendary Actions:** 3 Gauntlets = 105 damage.
    *   **Total Output:** ~175 damage/round (assuming all hits). This is hefty. It can melt a level 20 Wizard in one round.
*   **The "Fun Killer" Spells:** You gave him *Forcecage*, *Maze*, and *Wall of Force*.
    *   *Warning:* While strategically optimal, these are "anti-fun" spells. If Doom puts the Barbarian in a *Forcecage* or *Mazes* the Rogue, that player effectively stops playing D&D for an hour.
    *   *Suggestion:* consider swapping *Maze* for *Power Word Stun* or *Dominate Monster*—things that allow for dramatic saving throws rather than just "box logic."

### 5. Specific Ability Tweaks

**Arcane Gauntlet (Action)**
*   *Current:* "2d10 + 4 plus 4d8 force damage."
*   *Note:* Why is the Strength mod +4 here? His Strength is 18 (+4). However, as a super-genius using tech, he might use Intelligence for attacks (+6) or Dexterity.
*   *Feedback:* You have +13 to hit listed.
    *   Strength based: +4 + 7 (prof) = +11.
    *   Int based: +6 + 7 (prof) = +13.
    *   *Correction:* If it is +13 to hit, the damage bonus should likely be +6 (Int), not +4.

**Doombot Contingency (Trait)**
*   *Current:* Teleports and becomes invisible.
*   *Critique:* Does the invisibility end if he attacks or casts a spell? Standard *Invisibility* rules say yes. If you want him to remain hidden while prepping his next move, specify "Invisible as per the *Greater Invisibility* spell."
*   *The Bot:* Specify the Doombot acts immediately or on its own initiative. (Usually, "acts on Doom's initiative count" keeps combat smoother).

**Technomystic Overload (Action)**
*   The damage (12d8 lightning + 4d8 force = ~72 avg) is good.
*   The rider effect (disadvantage for metal armor/constructs) is a great flavor touch.

**Bonus Action: Tactical Teleport**
*   *Critique:* Why limited to 3/Day? He’s CR 23. Level 23 monsters usually have at-will teleports (like *Misty Step*). Limiting this feels unnecessary when he has tons of spell slots for *Misty Step* anyway.
*   *Suggestion:* Make it "Recharge 4-6" or just at-will. It keeps him mobile, which he needs to survive a Level 20 Fighter Action Surging on him.

### 6. Final Polish of the Statblock

Here is how I would tweak the specific confusing areas for maximum clarity and ease of play:

> **Reactions**
> ***Arcane Shielding.*** When Doom is hit by an attack or subjected to a *Magic Missile*, he creates a barrier of magical force. He gains a +5 bonus to AC against the triggering attack (and potentially subsequent attacks until the start of his next turn, akin to *Shield*) and takes no damage from *Magic Missile*.
>
> ***Runic Counterspell.*** Doom attempts to interrupt a creature he can see casting a spell. This works like the *Counterspell* spell (5th-level slot). If the creature is casting a spell of 6th level or higher, Doom makes an Intelligence check with a +13 bonus (DC 10 + spell's level).

*Removing the damage reduction aspect of Arcane Deflection simplifies the choice: Do I stop the spell, or do I stop the sword?*

### Should you include the Lair?
**YES.**
For a CR 23 villain, Lair Actions are almost mandatory to balance the Action Economy against a party of 4-6 high-level PCs.

**Suggested Lair Ideas:**
1.  **Anti-Magic Field Generator:** A specific 20ft radius zone becomes an antimagic field until initiative count 20 of the next round. (Forces martials to move in, casters to move out).
2.  **Swarm of Micro-Missiles:** Doom targets 3 creatures; they must make Dex saves or take fire damage. (A way to chip at concentration).
3.  **Diplomatic Immunity:** Doom recharges his *Legendary Resistance* (Costs 2 actions? Might be too strong, maybe just heals a doombot).

### Summary
This is a fantastic statblock.
1.  **Fix the To-Hit/Damage mod** on the Gauntlet (use Int +6).
2.  **Clean up the Reactions** (choose between the Spell *Shield* or the trait, don't keep both).
3.  **Clarify the Invisibility** on the Doombot contingency.

He is ready to TPK your party. Good work.
