***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. While wearing it, Doom can’t be disarmed, has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and gains a +2 bonus to melee weapon damage rolls (included in Doomfist Strike).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

***Doombot Decoy (1/Day).*** When Doom would be reduced to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point, teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet, and an inert Doombot shell (indistinguishable from Doom at a glance) collapses in the space he left. Any effect currently tracking Doom’s location (such as *hunter’s mark*) ends. Doom can’t use this trait if he is incapacitated.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks):  
**At will:** *detect magic, fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp*  
**3/day each:** *absorb elements, counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt, mirror image, misty step, shield*  
**2/day each:** *dimension door, disintegrate, dominate person, globe of invulnerability, greater invisibility, stoneskin, telekinesis, wall of force*  
**1/day each:** *dominate monster, forcecage, plane shift, time stop*

## Bonus Actions

***Personal Force Field (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Doom gains 30 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he has resistance to all damage.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. He can use this teleport even while grappled or restrained.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Doomfist Strike or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (1/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no material components.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Cantrip.*** Doom casts a cantrip.

***Commanding Step.*** Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Doomfist.*** Doom makes one Doomfist Strike attack.

***Arcane Gauntlet (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet Blast attack.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his Spellcasting list.

## Lair Actions (Castle Doom)

When fighting inside his lair, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

***Automated Defenses.*** Hidden turrets and arcane emitters strike. Each creature of Doom’s choice that he can see within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) force damage.

***Security Lockdown.*** Doom causes a door, portcullis, or force field he can see within 120 feet to slam shut or open. A passage up to 20 feet wide becomes blocked or unblocked (Doom’s choice).

***Holographic Duplicates.*** Doom creates 1d4 illusory duplicates that swirl around him until initiative count 20 on the next round. While at least one duplicate remains, attack rolls against Doom have disadvantage. Each time an attack misses Doom, one duplicate is destroyed.
