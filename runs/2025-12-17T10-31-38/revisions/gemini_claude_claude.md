***Diplomatic Immunity (1/Day).*** When Doom would drop to 0 hit points, he can choose to reveal that "Doom" was actually a Doombot. He teleports to a location he has prepared within 1 mile, and the Doombot is destroyed. Doom cannot use this feature if he has already used Legendary Resistance that day.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 30 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he is immune to the Stunned condition.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components for his spells. Additionally, Doom can maintain concentration on *mind blank* without it counting against his normal concentration limit.

***Supreme Arrogance.*** If a creature uses its action to make a DC 22 Charisma (Performance or Persuasion) check to mock or challenge Doom's superiority and succeeds, Doom has disadvantage on his next attack roll or ability check as he focuses on that creature. Once a creature attempts this, it cannot do so again until it completes a long rest.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
- 5th level (3 slots): *scrying, telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, teleport*
- 8th level (1 slot): *mind blank* (active)
- 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Titanium Gauntlet or Gauntlet Blast in any combination. He can substitute one attack for casting a spell of 3rd level or lower.

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon (3/Day).*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower, Doom can use his reaction to attempt to absorb the energy. The caster must make a spellcasting ability check contested by Doom's Intelligence check. If Doom wins, the spell fails and is wasted, and Doom regains one expended spell slot of a level equal to or less than half the absorbed spell's level (minimum 1st).

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Tactical Reposition.** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
- **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his list of prepared spells.
- **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational and psychic dominance. Each creature of Doom's choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, is knocked prone, and is restrained by crushing gravitational force until the end of Doom's next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.
