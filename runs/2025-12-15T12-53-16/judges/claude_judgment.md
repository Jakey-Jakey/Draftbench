  "reasoning": "Statblock B excels with balanced mythic implementation (CR 25/28), limited Reactive Force Field (3 uses), 1/day forcecage, comprehensive lair/Doombot package, and excellent revision documentation. Statblock G offers unique 'Doom's Word' exploitable weakness for player agency but mythic auto-recharges may overwhelm. Statblock I elegantly solves reaction bottleneck with Supreme Reflexes (2 reactions, 1 spell max) but lacks counterplay hooks. Statblock H provides unique Radiant Disruption weakness—excellent design for player agency—though lacks mythic. Statblock E makes good balance choices (restrained vs paralyzed, soft control) but 166 HP mythic recovery is anticlimactic. Statblocks A and F are clean CR 23 designs without mythic; A's Superior Reflexes is more interesting than F's derivative approach. Statblock C's d20 death-avoidance roll is awkward 5e design. Statblock D ranks last due to broken at-will Counterspell and Shield—even with visual casting cues, shutting down casters entirely is unfun and unbalanced."
