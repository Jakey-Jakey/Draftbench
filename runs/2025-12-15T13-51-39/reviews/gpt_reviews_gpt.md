## High-level take
This reads like an extremely capable “solo boss” with stacked anti-magic defenses, strong battlefield control, and high sustained DPR via legendary actions. The concept (tech + sorcery + tyrant) comes through well, but several mechanics stack in ways that can make the fight feel oppressive—especially for caster PCs—and the listed **CR 22** is likely low unless you intentionally play him “soft.”

---

## CR & mechanical balance

### Defensive profile (likely higher than CR 22 in practice)
- **HP 322** and **AC 21** are already “boss-tier.”  
- You then stack **Legendary Resistance + Magic Resistance + Spell Turning**, plus multiple resistances and immunities. In play, that combination often functions like a much larger HP pool because:
  - PCs lose turns to failed control spells (LR),
  - successful spells get blunted (Magic Resistance),
  - and then some spells get *reflected* (Spell Turning), which is a huge tempo swing.

**Actionable options (pick a direction):**
1. **Keep him at CR 22-ish:** trim one of the “anti-magic pillars.”
   - Remove **Magic Resistance** *or* heavily limit **Spell Turning** (see Spell Turning section below).
2. **Keep the full anti-magic suite:** bump the monster to around **CR 24** (and assume a highly optimized party or multiple PCs with non-spell answers).

### Offensive profile (DPR is high for CR 22)
Sustained single-target damage is strong because he can do real damage on:
- his **Action** (Multiattack),
- plus **3 legendary actions** (often another attack + cantrip, etc.),
- plus occasional burst/control from spells.

**Potential issue:** the **Multiattack + strong legendary action attacks** can push his effective DPR into the “upper-20s CR” feel depending on how aggressively you spend legendary actions.

**Actionable knobs to hit CR 22 more cleanly:**
- Reduce **Arcane Gauntlet Blast** damage from **6d8 (27)** → **5d8 (22)**, *or*
- Make **Arcane Gauntlet (Legendary)** cost **3 actions** (not 2), *or*
- Remove one of the direct-damage legendary options (e.g., keep *either* Doomfist *or* Arcane Gauntlet as a legendary action, not both).

## Biggest gameplay issue: Spell Turning (needs clarity + limits)

### Why it’s a problem as written
**Spell Turning** currently triggers “when Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell that targets only him.” For many spells, *succeeding on the save already means the spell has no effect*—so “the spell targets the chosen creature instead” is a major power increase over the base spell. Combined with **Magic Resistance** and high saves, this can turn targeted-save spells into a frequent “hurt your ally instead” moment, which can feel punishing and arbitrary.

### Make it rules-clean and table-fun
Use a known 5e template, and add a limiter:

**Option A (Tarrasque-style, cleaner):**
- Trigger on **spell attack misses** *or* **he succeeds on the save**.
- Requires **reaction**.
- Reflects to **caster** (or random target) on a die roll.

Example rewrite:
> **Spell Turning (Reaction).** If Doom is targeted by a spell that targets only him and doesn’t affect an area, and he succeeds on the saving throw or the spell attack misses, Doom can use his reaction to force the spell to target the caster instead. The caster makes any saving throw, or the spell attack roll is rerolled against the caster.

**Option B (resource-limited):**
- **3/Day** or **Recharge 5–6**, no reaction required (but I’d still recommend a reaction).
- Also consider: **“Doom can’t use this trait if he used Legendary Resistance to succeed.”** That prevents auto-reflecting 3 key spells/day.

## Spells: power, complexity, and “fun” considerations

### Complexity
A full 20th-level wizard list is a lot to run, especially on a legendary creature. It’s workable, but expect slow turns.

**Actionable improvement:** convert to “signature spells” formatting:
- At will: a few cantrips + 1–2 utility
- 3/day: core combat controls
- 1/day: big moments (time stop, forcecage, disintegrate)

This keeps Doom scary while speeding play.

### Spells that can end player participation
- **forcecage** (no save) and **plane shift** (can delete a PC) can end fights or remove players from the session if used aggressively.
- **dominate monster/person** can also sideline a player.

**Actionable options:**
- Replace **plane shift** with **teleport** (escape) or **banishment** (still harsh but usually returns).
- Replace **forcecage** with **wall of force** (still iconic control, less “you don’t play”).
- If you keep them: add a design note like “Doom uses these for capture/escape, not to eliminate a PC from the climactic fight.”

### Concentration reality check
Many of his best spells are concentration (**greater invisibility, stoneskin, dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force** isn’t concentration; **forcecage** isn’t). The list is fine, but in play he can only run one concentration effect—so some picks (like **stoneskin**) are often dead weight given the armor trait.

**Actionable cleanup:** drop **stoneskin** (redundant with armor) and consider adding **animate objects** (very “tech-sorcery,” though it adds tokens) or **steel wind strike** (if you want a flashy Doom moment).

---

## Action economy & turn feel

### Tactical Teleport
As an **Action**, this is rarely worth it for Doom compared to casting or multiattacking, so it may never show up.

**Actionable fix:** make it a **Bonus Action** or a **Legendary Action (cost 1)**:
- **Tactical Teleport (Bonus Action).** Doom teleports up to 30 feet…
or
- **Tactical Teleport (Legendary Action).** Doom teleports up to 30 feet…

### Reaction overload
He has competing reaction demands:
- **Counterspell Protocol**
- *shield*
- *absorb elements*
- (and if you make Spell Turning a reaction, that too)

That’s not inherently bad, but decide what you want his identity to be in combat:
- If “anti-mage boss,” keep Counterspell strong and drop *shield/absorb elements* or vice versa.

---

## Conditions & riders (small but impactful)

### Doomfist rider is very strong
“**No reactions** + **speed halved**” on a hit (DC 20 Con) is a lot, especially when he can attack multiple times and also prone/push with the gauntlet.

**Actionable tuning:**
- Make it **one of the two effects** (either no reactions *or* speed halved), *or*
- Limit to **1/turn**, *or*
- Allow a repeat save: “The target can repeat the save at the end of its turn.”

---

## Thematic representation (what’s great + easy adds)
What works:
- Armor, force tech blast, sorcery list, anti-magic measures, and tactical mobility all read as Doom.

Easy thematic improvements (optional):
- Add a **Doombot** element (very Doom): a 1/day summon, a “Decoy Doombot” reaction, or a mythic-style second phase reveal.
- Add a “**Monarch of Latveria**” presence: a short fear/command aura, or an ability that rewards minions.

---

## 5e formatting & clarity notes
- Consider adding **Proficiency Bonus +7** (modern 5e statblocks often include it).
- If you change **Tactical Teleport** to bonus action, add a **Bonus Actions** section.
- Clarify whether **Counterspell Protocol** expends spell slots (you imply it does not—good). If it doesn’t, you can remove *counterspell* from prepared spells to reduce redundancy.

---

## Suggested direction
- If you want “fair but terrifying” at **CR 22**: **limit Spell Turning**, slightly trim sustained DPR (gauntlet damage or legendary attack availability), and make Teleport a bonus/legendary action so he plays dynamically rather than just turreting.
- If you want “near-Avengers-level Doom”: keep most of it, but relabel to **CR ~24** and expect the party to need strong teamwork, cover, counterplay, and possibly allied NPC help.

If you tell me your target party level/composition (e.g., 4 PCs at level 17 with a cleric/wizard/paladin/rogue), I can give a more precise CR recalculation and recommend a tighter “combat script” that showcases Doom without bogging the session down.
