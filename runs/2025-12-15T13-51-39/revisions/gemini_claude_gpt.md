***Arcane Savant.*** Doom’s proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check he makes that uses the Arcana skill.

***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to divination magic and to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically compel him to speak the truth (such as *detect thoughts* or *zone of truth*), unless he allows it.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
- **6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, disintegrate*
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*
- **8th level (1 slot):** *power word stun*
- **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

***Contingency Protocol (1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he can use his reaction to cast *dimension door* without expending a spell slot. He appears in an unoccupied space he can visualize within range, typically a secure location or adjacent to a prepared Doombot.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks using Arcane Gauntlets and/or Electrified Touch, in any combination.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons 1d4 Doombots to unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. Each Doombot uses **Helmed Horror** statistics, except it has Intelligence 18 and speaks the languages Doom speaks. The Doombots obey Doom’s verbal commands and take their turns immediately after his.

---

## Bonus Actions

***Emergency Teleport (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom casts *misty step* without expending a spell slot.

---

## Reactions

***Personal Force Field (Recharge 5–6).*** When Doom takes damage, he can halve the damage against him (after resistances). If the damage is from a spell or other magical effect, Doom instead reduces the damage by half and has advantage on the next saving throw he makes before the end of his next turn.

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell, Doom can use his reaction to cast *counterspell* (using a 3rd-level slot unless he chooses to expend a higher one). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains hit points equal to 5 × the level of the spell countered.

---

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
- **Electrified Jab.** Doom makes one attack with his Electrified Touch.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells.
- **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions; Recharge 5–6).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a prepared containment site within 1 mile (such as a warded cell or holding chamber). If the target has more than half its hit points remaining, it has advantage on this saving throw. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, returning to the space it left (or the nearest unoccupied space) on a success. If the destination space can’t contain the target, the effect fails and is wasted.

## Lair Actions (Castle Doom)

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Security Lockdown.** Reinforced steel barriers seal up to two doorways Doom can see within 120 feet. A sealed doorway can be forced open with a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check as an action, or destroyed (AC 19; 40 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage).
- **Gas Release.** Doom fills a 20-foot cube he can see within 120 feet with knockout gas until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.
- **Doombot Deployment.** One Doombot (as in Summon Doombots) emerges from a hidden alcove in an unoccupied space Doom can see within 60 feet and takes its turn immediately after Doom’s (this Doombot lasts for 1 minute, until destroyed, or until Doom dismisses it as a bonus action).
