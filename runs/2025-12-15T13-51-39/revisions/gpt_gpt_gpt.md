***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. While he wears it, Doom has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and he can’t be disarmed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Spell Turning (3/Day; Reaction).*** When Doom is targeted by a spell that targets only him (not an area) and he succeeds on the saving throw against it or the spell attack misses him, he can force the spell to instead target the spell’s caster. The caster makes any saving throw against the spell, or the spell attack is rerolled against the caster. Doom can’t use this reaction if he chose to succeed on the saving throw using Legendary Resistance.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
- **At will:** *detect magic, fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp*  
- **3/day each:** *absorb elements, dimension door, dispel magic, dominate person, greater invisibility, hold person, lightning bolt, mirror image, misty step, shield, telekinesis, wall of force*  
- **1/day each:** *disintegrate, dominate monster, globe of invulnerability, teleport, time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks, using Doomfist Strike and/or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can make only one Arcane Gauntlet Blast as part of this multiattack. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (5d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no material components.
