This is a very impressive statblock. You have captured the "God Emperor" vibe of Doctor Doom effectively. He feels powerful, intelligent, and appropriately arrogant. A DM running this creates a scenario where the players are fighting a master of both technology and magic.

However, from a game design and balance perspective, there are several "pain points" that would make this encounter strictly unfun or tedious to play, rather than challenging. He suffers from **action economy bloat** and **durability inflation**.

Here is a detailed breakdown and actionable feedback.

### 1. Formatting and Conventions
The formatting is excellent and adheres closely to standard 5e style manuals.
*   **XP Calculation:** 62,000 XP matches CR 24.
*   **Math:** Proficiencies (+7) and Ability Scores align correctly with skills and saves.
*   **Hit Dice:** The hit points are calculated correctly based on Constitution.

### 2. Defensive Tuning (The "Slog" Factor)
This is the biggest mechanical issue. Doom is currently mathematically oppressive to fight, bordering on tedious.

*   **The Problem:** Between AC 23, the *Shield Protocol* reaction (boosting AC to 28), and the **Force Field** bonus action (40 Temporary HP per round), Doom effectively heals 40 HP a turn and ignores most martial attacks. A Fighter with a +13 to hit needs to roll a 15 or higher just to hit his AC 28. If they do hit, they are just chipping away the Temp HP.
*   **The Fix:**
    *   **Nerf Force Field:** Change the Bonus Action to: "Doom recharges his deflective plating, gaining 20 temporary hit points." Or, make it a Recharge (4–6) ability if you keep it at 40.
    *   **Shield Protocol:** This is redundant with him having the *Shield* spell prepared. I recommend removing the *Shield* spell from his prepared list to free up a slot, OR remove *Shield Protocol* and just let him use the spell. Having both confuses the DM's options.

### 3. Action Economy & Spellcasting
Doom breaks several "soft caps" regarding how many high-level spells a monster should cast in a round.

*   **Multiattack Spellcasting:** Being able to replace one attack with a spell of **5th level or lower** is very strong (usually capped at cantrips or 3rd level for monsters), but acceptable for CR 24.
*   **Legendary Action (Cast a Spell):** Allowing a **7th level spell** as a legendary action costs 3 actions is dangerous.
    *   *Scenario:* On his turn, Doom casts *Forcecage* (7th). On the Fighter's turn, Doom uses Legendary Actions to cast *Finger of Death* (7th).
    *   *Result:* This creates a "Rocket Tag" scenario where players grant him too much overwhelming power.
    *   *Fix:* Cap the Legendary Action casting at **3rd level or lower**, or perhaps a specific list (like *Dispel Magic* or *Misty Step*). He is already casting 5th level spells via Multiattack.

### 4. Lair Actions: The Doombot Issue
*   **The Problem:** The **Deploy Doombot** Lair Action is problematic. Summoning an "Archmage" (even a stripped-down one) is adding a CR 12 creature to the board. If the fight lasts 5 rounds, he could theoretically summon 3 of these. The stat block description ("Use archmage statistics with these changes...") is also too much bookkeeping for a DM mid-combat.
*   **The Fix:** Create a specific, simplified "Doombot" statblock (CR 5-7 Construct) and reference it. It should have roughly:
    *   HP: 60
    *   AC: 16
    *   Action: Force Beam (+9 to hit, 22 damage).
    *   Feature: If Doom takes damage, he can swap places with a Doombot within 30 ft (The Doombot takes the damage instead). *This fits the lore perfectly.*

### 5. Specific Ability Critiques

**Reaction: Power Absorption**
*   **Critique:** This is a cool mechanic, but tracking spell slots for an NPC is already a headache. Regaining slots adds more bookkeeping.
*   **Suggestion:** Instead of regaining a slot, make it an immediate punishment. "Doom absorbs the energy. The caster takes force damage equal to 5 x the spell's level." This keeps the threat high without adding math for the DM.

**Legendary Action: Electroshock**
*   **Critique:** Stunning players until the end of Doom's *next* turn is a "skip turn" mechanic. In high-level play, taking a player out of the game for a full round is generally frowned upon unless it requires concentration.
*   **Suggestion:** Change condition to **Paralyzed** until the **end of the creature's next turn** (allows a save at the end of their turn) or **Incapacitated**.

**Regional Effects**
*   **Critique:** Being aware when his name is spoken is great flavor.
*   **Check:** Ensure the "Scrying at will" doesn't bog down the game if players are trying to plan. This effectively means "Plan inside a Mordenkainen's Sanctum or Doom knows your plan." (Which is fair for a Tier 4 boss).

### 6. Thematic Polish

*   **Diplomatic Immunity:** You might consider adding a "flavor" trait or a note that Doom is a head of state. While not a combat stat, it affects how players approach the fight (they can't just murder-hobo him in a public square).
*   **Ego:** Doom is defined by his arrogance. Consider adding a flaw: *If a creature creates an illusion of Reed Richards or mocks Doom's intelligence, Doom has disadvantage on attack rolls against other targets until he deals damage to the offender.*

### Summary of Recommended Changes
Here is how I would tweak the specific numbers to make this run smoother at the table:

1.  **Reduce Bonus Action Temp HP** to 20 (or make it a Recharge 5-6 Action for 40).
2.  **Legendary Action Cast a Spell:** Cap at 3rd Level.
3.  **Lair Action (Doombot):** Summon a "Doombot Minion" (Construct, ~50 HP) rather than a complex modified Archmage.
4.  **Reaction (Shield Protocol):** Clarify that this consumes a 1st level spell slot (functionally casting *Shield*), or remove it and rely on the Spellcasting trait.
5.  **Multiattack:** Clarify "He can replace one attack with casting a spell of **Cantrip or 1st-3rd level**." (Uncapped to 5th level allows for *Wall of Force* spam every turn while still attacking, which is unfun).

### Verdict
**Current Status:** CR 25+ (Defensive). A mathematical brick wall that will frustrate players via high AC/Regen/Stuns.
**Goal:** CR 24 (Balanced).
**Final Thought:** This is an amazing "Final Boss." With the tweaks to action economy to reduce the bookkeeping and the "slog" of chewing through his HP, this will be a memorable encounter. The lore integration (armor quirks, magic/tech mix) is top-tier.
