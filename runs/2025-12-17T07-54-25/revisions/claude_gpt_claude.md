___

***Armor of Doom.*** Doom's armor is a masterwork fusion of science and sorcery. While wearing it, Doom doesn't need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and he can survive in the vacuum of space. The armor can't be removed against his will. If Doom would be moved against his will, he reduces the distance by up to 30 feet.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically put him to sleep. Divination spells automatically fail if used to target or locate Doom unless he allows it.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Doom's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *detect magic*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*
3/day each: *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *fireball*, *hold person*, *misty step*, *shield*
2/day each: *banishment*, *dimension door*, *hold monster*, *wall of force*
1/day each: *chain lightning*, *disintegrate*, *dominate monster*, *forcecage*, *globe of invulnerability*, *maze*, *teleport*, *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Energy Blast, or a combination of both.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) lightning damage.

***Energy Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d10) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating blast from his armor. Each creature in a 90-foot cone must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

***Force Field (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom activates his armor's defensive systems, gaining 40 temporary hit points.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Power Absorption.*** When Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell of 5th level or lower, or when such a spell misses him, he absorbs the spell's energy and gains temporary hit points equal to 5 × the spell's level (minimum 5).

***Shield Protocol (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he gains +5 AC against that attack or immunity to the *magic missile*, potentially causing it to miss.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check.

**Energy Blast.** Doom makes one Energy Blast attack.

**Electroshock (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature Doom can see within 20 feet of him must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of that creature's next turn. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't stunned.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his Innate Spellcasting, expending a use as normal.

___

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Hidden weapons activate. Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

- **Lockdown.** Each creature of Doom's choice within the lair must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be restrained by metal restraints until initiative count 20 of the next round. A restrained creature can use its action to attempt a DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself on a success.

- **Deploy Doombot.** A Doombot (Medium construct, AC 17, 99 HP, immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, speed 30 ft.) appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom and acts on initiative count 10. On its turn, the Doombot makes two ranged attacks: +9 to hit, range 120 ft., 22 (4d10) force damage on a hit. A maximum of one Doombot can be active at a time; it is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or when Doom is destroyed.

- **Power Surge.** Each creature of Doom's choice within the lair that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

___

## Regional Effects

The region within 6 miles of Doom's primary lair is altered by his technology and magic:

- Doom is instantly aware when any creature speaks his name within this region.
- Doom can cast *scrying* at will (no components required) targeting any creature within 1 mile of his lair.
- Surveillance throughout the region makes it impossible to surprise Doom while he is in his lair, and he has advantage on initiative rolls there.

If Doom is destroyed, these effects end immediately, but the technological infrastructure remains functional for 1d10 days.
