# Original Statblock (gemini)

Here is a D&D 5e statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

This build focuses on his dual mastery of science and sorcery. He acts as a "Tank Caster"—he has the hit points and AC of a martial boss, but the spellcasting capability of an Archmage. He is designed to be a Challenge Rating 24 boss, suitable for a party of level 17–20 adventurers.

**_Armor of Vibranium and Magic._** Doom’s AC includes his Intelligence modifier. Additionally, the armor filters toxins and recycles energy. If Doom is subjected to lightning damage, he takes no damage and instead regains hit points equal to half the lightning damage dealt.

**_Indomitable Will._** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Master of Science and Sorcery._** Doom can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time. If he fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, he chooses which spell ends.

**_Ovoid Mind Transfer (Mythic Trait)._** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, his body does not die immediately. Instead, he attempts to swap minds with a creature within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or their soul is ejected, and Doom’s consciousness takes over their body (retaining his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, but adopting the target's physical stats). If the target succeeds, or if there are no targets, Doom’s body collapses, revealing it was a Doombot all along (see Reactions), or he uses a contingency teleport to escape.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets or casts one spell and makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.

**_Arcane Gauntlet._** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**_Frightful Presence._** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of the Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Spellcasting._** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 26, +18 to hit with spell attacks). Doom can cast *shield* and *misty step* at will. He has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, prestidigitation, shocking grasp, toll the dead*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, mirror image*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt, fly*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
*   5th level (3 slots): *animate objects, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, reverse gravity*
*   8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Reactions

**_Doombot Decoy (1/Day)._** When Doom is hit by an attack represented by a roll of 20 or reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, he can reveal that the damage was taken by a Doombot. The current body explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The *real* Doctor Doom appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet, with full hit points and resources (excluding this reaction).

**_Tech-Shield._** Doom adds 5 to his AC against one attack that would hit him. To do so, Doom must see the attacker.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *command* (at 5th level) or *hold person* (at 5th level) without expending a spell slot.

***

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Security Systems.** Automated turrets extend from the walls. Doom makes two ranged weapon attacks (+15 to hit) against creatures of his choice within 120 feet. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.
*   **Nullification Field.** Doom activates a dampening field. All creatures within 60 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or lose concentration on any spells they are currently maintaining.
*   **Summon Doombots.** Doom summons 1d4 **Helmed Horrors** (re-flavored as Doombots) in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act immediately after Doom in the initiative order.

### Tactical Notes for the DM

1.  **Arrogance is Key:** Doom does not dodge; he tanks. He does not run; he tactically repositions. He rarely yells; he commands. When a player misses an attack, describe it as Doom simply catching the blade or letting it bounce harmlessly off his force field while he looks bored.
2.  **The Double Concentration:** This is his deadliest feature. He can Trap the Barbarian in a *Forcecage* (concentration) while flying around casting *Telekinesis* or *Globe of Invulnerability* (concentration).
3.  **The Decoy:** Use the **Doombot Decoy** reaction to terrify the players. Let them burn their highest-level spell slots ("Paladin Smite", "Meteor Swarm") on the first "Doom" they see. Once that body explodes, bringing the *real* Doom onto the field with full HP is a massive morale blow to the party.
4.  **Spell Selection:** Doom uses *Time Stop* to buff himself (Mirror Image, Fire Shield) or position himself perfectly. He uses *Power Word Stun* on the healer. He uses *Counterspell* aggressively.
