___

***Armor of Doom.*** Doom's armor is a masterwork fusion of science and sorcery. While wearing it, Doom doesn't need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and he can survive in the vacuum of space. The armor can't be removed against his will. If Doom would be moved against his will, he reduces the distance by up to 30 feet.

***Diplomatic Immunity.*** Doom is the sovereign ruler of Latveria. In any nation that recognizes his sovereignty, harming, detaining, or magically compelling Doom can trigger severe political and legal consequences at the DM’s discretion.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically put him to sleep. Divination spells automatically fail if used to target or locate Doom unless he allows it.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *shocking grasp*  
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *magic missile*, *shield*  
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person*, *misty step*, *scorching ray*  
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *fireball*  
4th level (3 slots): *banishment*, *dimension door*, *greater invisibility*  
5th level (3 slots): *dominate person*, *hold monster*, *wall of force*  
6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning*, *disintegrate*, *globe of invulnerability*  
7th level (2 slots): *finger of death*, *forcecage*, *teleport*  
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster*, *maze*  
9th level (1 slot): *power word kill*, *time stop*

***Wounded Pride.*** If a creature Doom can see mocks his intellect, questions his superiority, or presents an illusion of Reed Richards (DM’s discretion), Doom has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than the offender until Doom deals damage to the offender.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Energy Blast, or a combination of both. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip or a spell of 1st–3rd level.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) lightning damage.

***Energy Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (5d10 + 5) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating blast from his armor. Each creature in a 90-foot cone must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Bonus Actions

***Force Field.*** Doom recharges his deflective plating, gaining 20 temporary hit points.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Power Absorption.*** When Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell of 6th level or lower, or when such a spell attack misses him, Doom absorbs the spell’s energy and lashes it back. If Doom can see the spell’s caster and the caster is within 120 feet of Doom, the caster takes 5 force damage per level of the spell (minimum 5 force damage).

***Doombot Decoy.*** When Doom would take damage, he can swap places (teleporting, no opportunity attacks) with a Doombot within 30 feet of him that he can see. The Doombot takes the damage instead, and any additional effects of the triggering damage apply to the Doombot. Excess damage doesn’t carry over to Doom.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check.

**Energy Blast.** Doom makes one Energy Blast attack.

**Electroshock (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Hidden weapons activate. Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.

- **Lockdown.** Each creature of Doom's choice within the lair must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be restrained by metal restraints until initiative count 20 of the next round. A restrained creature can use its action to attempt a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself on a success.

- **Deploy Doombot.** If there are no Doombots in the lair, a Doombot appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom and acts on initiative count 10.

- **Power Surge.** Each creature of Doom's choice that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

___

## Regional Effects

The region within 6 miles of Doom's primary lair is altered by his technology and magic:

- Doom is instantly aware when any creature speaks his name within this region.  
- Doom can cast *scrying* at will (no components required) targeting any creature within 1 mile of his lair.  
- Surveillance throughout the region makes it impossible to surprise Doom while he is in his lair, and he has advantage on initiative rolls there.

If Doom is destroyed, these effects end immediately, but the technological infrastructure remains functional for 1d10 days.
