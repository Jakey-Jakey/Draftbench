***Arcane Technology.*** Doom's armor serves as an arcane focus for his spellcasting. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Expertise.*** Doom's proficiency bonus is doubled for Arcana checks (included in the skill).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Blank (Pre-Cast).*** At the start of each day, Doom casts *mind blank* on himself, requiring no spell slot. While the spell is active, no creature can perceive his emotions, read his thoughts, determine if he is lying, or target him with divination magic unless Doom allows it.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
- 5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift* (willing creatures only)
- 8th level (1 slot): *power word stun*
- 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks: two Arcane Gauntlet attacks, or one Arcane Gauntlet attack and one Electrified Touch attack.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Doom's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombot (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons a Doombot (use **helmed horror** statistics with an Intelligence of 18) to an unoccupied space within 60 feet. The Doombot acts on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), obeys Doom's verbal commands, and remains until destroyed or until Doom dismisses it (no action required). Only one Doombot summoned by this ability can exist at a time.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell of 4th level or higher, Doom can cast *counterspell* as a reaction, expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher as normal. If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains hit points equal to 5 × the spell's level.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Gauntlet Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
- **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level with a casting time of 1 action from his prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.
- **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space Doom can see within 60 feet and be restrained until the end of its next turn.
