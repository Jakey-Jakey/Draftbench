## Traits

***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor is a masterwork of technology and arcane engineering. While wearing his armor, Doom can breathe in any environment (including vacuum), cannot be targeted by divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors, and has a flying speed of 60 feet.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts. He cannot be compelled to act against his will by any magical means. Additionally, Doom cannot be surprised while conscious.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Reactive Force Field.*** When Doom takes damage, he can use his reaction to activate his armor's force field, reducing the damage by 40 (to a minimum of 0). Doom can use this feature 9 times, regaining all expended uses after completing a long rest.

***Supreme Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier (+9) to initiative rolls. He cannot be deceived by illusions of 6th level or lower.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Blast.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage.

***Micro-Missile Barrage (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom launches a salvo of micro-missiles in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Neural Disruptor (Recharge 6).*** Doom fires a neural disruption beam at one creature within 90 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 65 (10d12) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of Doom's next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn't stunned.

---

## Bonus Actions

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom flies up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Activate Doombot.*** Doom remotely activates a concealed Doombot within 120 feet. The Doombot appears in an unoccupied space and acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order.

---

## Reactions

***Unworthy.*** When a creature within 5 feet of Doom misses him with a melee attack, Doom makes one Gauntlet Strike against that creature.

***Doom Endures.*** When Doom would be banished, teleported against his will, or subjected to an effect that would alter his form, he can choose to automatically succeed on the saving throw. Once he uses this reaction, he can't do so again until he finishes a short or long rest.

---

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or casts *detect magic* without expending a spell slot.

**Plasma Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Blast attack.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 4th level or lower from his prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.

---

## Mythic Trait

***Doom Is Supreme (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, his armor's emergency protocols activate: he regains 180 hit points, all conditions affecting him end, and his Reactive Force Field regains all uses. For 1 hour or until he completes a rest:

- His Micro-Missile Barrage and Neural Disruptor recharge at the start of each of his turns.
- His AC increases by 2 (total AC 26).
- He can use the Mythic Actions below.

When this trait activates, Doom can immediately use one legendary action option (regardless of its cost) as a free action.

---

## Mythic Actions

If Doom's mythic trait is active, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

**Summon Doombots (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom activates 1d4 + 1 Doombots in unoccupied spaces within 120 feet.

**Annihilation Beam (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom fires a devastating beam in a 120-foot long, 10-foot wide line. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

# LAIR: CASTLE DOOM

Castle Doom in Latveria is Doctor Doom's ancestral fortress—a technological marvel hidden within a medieval facade, protected by automated defenses, legions of Doombots, and layers of magical wards.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. He can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Energy weapons fire from concealed positions. Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Lockdown Protocol.** Force fields spring up, creating walls of force (as the *wall of force* spell) at locations Doom specifies. The walls last until initiative count 20 on the next round.

- **Summon Doombots.** Two Doombots emerge from hidden alcoves in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of Doom.

- **Total Surveillance.** Doom learns the exact location, current hit points, and all conditions affecting every creature within the lair.

## Regional Effects

The region within 5 miles of Castle Doom is altered by Doom's influence:

- Doom is instantly aware when any non-native creature enters the region.
- Scrying and divination magic targeting the region or creatures within automatically fails.
- Electronic and magical communications can be monitored, blocked, or intercepted by Doom at will.
- Creatures native to Latveria have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened.

If Doom dies, these effects fade over 1d10 days.

***False Doom.*** A Doombot is virtually indistinguishable from Doctor Doom. A creature that uses its action to examine the Doombot can determine it is a construct with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or automatically if they deal damage to it and see sparks/circuitry.

***Doom's Protocols.*** The Doombot is immune to any effect that would reveal its true nature or read its thoughts.

***Self-Destruct.*** When the Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

---

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (3d8 + 1) force damage.

***Spellcasting (1/Day Each).*** The Doombot can cast *counterspell*, *fireball*, and *shield* (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit), requiring no material components.

# DESIGN NOTES

> **Encounter Balance:** As a CR 25 creature with a mythic trait, Doctor Doom represents approximately two CR 25 encounters back-to-back. A party of four level 20 characters should find this a deadly but fair capstone battle.
>
> **Tactics:** Doom opens with *time stop* to buff or reposition, uses *forcecage* and *wall of force* to isolate targets, reserves *counterspell* for enemy casters, and employs Doombots as distractions. He fights with calculated superiority—never desperate, always in control.
>
> **Roleplaying Doom:** Doom refers to himself in the third person. He never begs, never retreats without purpose, and considers mercy a gift he rarely bestows. Even in defeat, he maintains absolute dignity. His word, once given, is ironclad.
>
> **Without Mythic:** For a shorter encounter, ignore the mythic trait. Doom becomes a standard CR 25 solo encounter.
