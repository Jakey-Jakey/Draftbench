***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor grants the following benefits: his AC includes his Intelligence modifier, he can breathe in any environment including vacuum, he is immune to disease, and he has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will. Additionally, Doom can perform somatic and material components for spells while wearing this armor.

***Doombot Contingency (1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he can choose to reveal that this was a Doombot decoy. If he does, the decoy form is destroyed (triggering no death saves or effects that trigger on death), and the true Doctor Doom appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet with half his hit point maximum (168 HP). A creature can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check while observing Doom in combat; on a success, the creature discerns whether it is observing the true Doom or a decoy.

***Indomitable Will.*** If Doom succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or having his mind read or controlled, the creature that forced the save takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
1st level (4 slots): *absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile, shield*
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, misty step, scorching ray*
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility, wall of fire*
5th level (3 slots): *cone of cold, hold monster, telekinesis, wall of force*
6th level (1 slot): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
7th level (1 slot): *forcecage, plane shift, teleport*
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, power word stun*
9th level (1 slot): *power word kill, time stop*

***Supreme Intellect.*** Doom can use a bonus action to analyze a creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the end of Doom's next turn, he has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the next saving throw the creature makes against one of Doom's spells or abilities is made with disadvantage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of arcane devastation. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 55 (10d10) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 1d4 + 1 **Doombots** in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act on his initiative, obey his commands, and last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Energy Shield (3/Day).*** Doom gains resistance to all damage until the start of his next turn.

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, he can use his reaction to add +5 to his AC against that attack or +5 to the saving throw result, potentially causing the attack to miss or the save to succeed.

***Retributive Strike.*** When a creature within 60 feet damages Doom, he forces it to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure, or half on a success.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Analyze.** Doom uses Supreme Intellect.
**Teleport.** Doom uses Tactical Repositioning.
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower, expending a slot.
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of Doom's next turn. A successful save halves the damage with no stun.

---

## LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action while in Castle Doom to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombots (Max 2/Day).** Two **Doombots** emerge from hidden alcoves within 60 feet of Doom.
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failure, or half on a success.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors and passages seal shut (AC 18, 50 HP, immune to poison and psychic damage). Doom can open any sealed door at will.
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point within 120 feet. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.
