## Traits

***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor is a masterwork of technology and arcane engineering. While wearing his armor, Doom can breathe in any environment (including vacuum), is under the constant effect of *nondetection* (requiring no spell slot), and has a flying speed of 60 feet.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is under the constant effect of *mind blank* (requiring no spell slot). Additionally, Doom cannot be surprised while conscious.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Reactive Force Field (3/Day).*** When Doom takes damage, he can use his reaction to activate his armor's force field, reducing the damage by 30 (to a minimum of 0). Doom regains all expended uses when his Doom Is Supreme trait activates.

***Supreme Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to initiative rolls. He cannot be deceived by illusions of 6th level or lower.

***Doombot Network.*** Doom can have no more than 4 Doombots active at a time. Doombots share a telepathic link with Doom within 1 mile and can relay sensory information to him.

---

## Spellcasting

Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). Doom requires no material components for his spells, as his armor functions as an arcane focus. He has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will):** *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*

**1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile*

**2nd level (3 slots):** *hold person, mirror image, misty step*

**3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*

**4th level (3 slots):** *arcane eye, dimension door, greater invisibility*

**5th level (3 slots):** *cone of cold, dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force*

**6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*

**7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage†, reverse gravity, teleport*

**8th level (1 slot):** *dominate monster, maze*

**9th level (1 slot):** *power word kill, time stop*

†Doom can cast *forcecage* once per day.

---

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Blast.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d10 + 9) force damage.

***Micro-Missile Barrage (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom launches a salvo of micro-missiles in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Neural Disruptor (Recharge 6).*** Doom fires a neural disruption beam at one creature within 90 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of Doom's next turn. On a success, the target takes half damage and isn't stunned.

---

## Bonus Actions

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom flies up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Activate Doombot (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom remotely activates a concealed Doombot within 120 feet. The Doombot appears in an unoccupied space and rolls its own initiative, acting on that count thereafter.

---

## Reactions

***Unworthy.*** When a creature within 5 feet of Doom misses him with a melee attack, Doom makes one Gauntlet Strike against that creature.

***Doom Endures.*** When Doom would be banished, teleported against his will, or subjected to a polymorph effect, he can use his reaction to automatically succeed on the saving throw. Once he uses this reaction, he can't do so again until he finishes a short or long rest.

---

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check.

**Plasma Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Blast attack.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

---

## Mythic Trait

***Doom Is Supreme (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, his armor's emergency protocols activate: he regains 150 hit points, all conditions affecting him end, and his Reactive Force Field regains all expended uses. For 1 hour or until he completes a rest:

- At the start of each of his turns, Doom chooses one: his Micro-Missile Barrage **or** his Neural Disruptor recharges.
- His AC increases by 2 (total AC 24).
- He can use the Mythic Actions below.

When this trait activates, Doom can immediately use Tactical Repositioning as a free action.

---

## Mythic Actions

If Doom's mythic trait is active, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

**Deploy Doombot (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom activates one Doombot in an unoccupied space within 120 feet. It acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order.

**Annihilation Beam (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom fires a devastating beam in a 120-foot long, 10-foot wide line. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

---

# LAIR: CASTLE DOOM

Castle Doom in Latveria is Doctor Doom's ancestral fortress—a technological marvel hidden within a medieval facade, protected by automated defenses, legions of Doombots, and layers of magical wards.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. He can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Energy weapons fire from concealed positions. Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Lockdown Protocol.** Force fields spring up, creating up to two 10-foot square panels of *wall of force* at locations Doom can see. The walls last until initiative count 20 on the next round.

- **Summon Doombot.** One Doombot emerges from a hidden alcove in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom. It rolls its own initiative.

- **Tactical Analysis.** Doom learns the exact location of every creature within the lair and whether each creature is above or below half its hit point maximum.

## Regional Effects

The region within 5 miles of Castle Doom is altered by Doom's influence:

- Doom is instantly aware when any non-native creature enters the region.
- Scrying and divination magic targeting the region or creatures within automatically fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 25 ability check using their spellcasting ability.
- Electronic and magical communications can be monitored, blocked, or intercepted by Doom at will.
- Creatures native to Latveria have disadvantage on saving throws against the frightened condition while within 1 mile of Castle Doom.

If Doom dies, these effects fade over 1d10 days.

---

***False Doom.*** A Doombot is programmed to perfectly imitate Doctor Doom in appearance, voice, and mannerisms, granting it expertise in Deception (included in the skill above). A creature that uses its action to examine the Doombot can determine it is a construct with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or automatically if they deal damage to it and see sparks or circuitry.

***Doom's Protocols.*** The Doombot is immune to any effect that would read its thoughts or magically reveal its true nature.

***Self-Destruct.*** When the Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, or when Doom uses a bonus action to trigger it while within 1 mile, it explodes. Each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

---

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Doombot makes two Gauntlet Blast attacks.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) force damage.

---

## Reactions

***Counterspell (1/Day).*** When the Doombot sees a creature within 60 feet casting a spell, it casts *counterspell* at 3rd level (+5 to ability checks made as part of the spell).

***Arcane Shield (2/Day).*** When the Doombot is hit by an attack, it casts *shield*, gaining a +5 bonus to AC until the start of its next turn, including against the triggering attack.

# DESIGN NOTES

> **Encounter Balance:** Doctor Doom is a CR 25 creature. With his mythic trait, he represents two consecutive CR 25 encounters (effectively CR 28 overall). A party of four 20th-level characters with appropriate magic items should find this a challenging but achievable capstone battle. In Castle Doom with lair actions, treat this as apex difficulty.
>
> **Key Changes from Original:**
> - AC reduced from 24 to 22; *shield* removed from spell list
> - Reactive Force Field reduced from 9 uses/40 reduction to 3 uses/30 reduction
> - Multiattack reduced from 3 attacks to 2
> - Doombot cap of 4 added; summoning requires recharge
> - *Forcecage* limited to 1/day; *power word stun* replaced with *maze*
> - Mythic phase: only one recharge per turn (choice), not both
> - Mythic Doombot summon: 1 instead of 1d4+1
> - Lair action DC increased to 22; Lockdown limited to two panels
> - All math errors corrected; ability references clarified
>
> **Counterplay Hooks:** Players can thin Doom's action economy by eliminating Doombots (at range to avoid self-destruct). *Dispel magic* removes *wall of force* effects. Anti-magic zones devastate Doom's capabilities. His force field has limited uses—sustained offense depletes it rapidly. *Forcecage* is once per day, so surviving it removes a major threat.
>
> **Tactics:** Doom opens with *time stop* to position and buff with *greater invisibility* or *mirror image*. He isolates dangerous targets with *wall of force* (or his single *forcecage*), reserves *counterspell* for enemy casters, and treats his mythic phase as a calculated contingency rather than a desperate measure. He uses Doombots to absorb attacks and provide flanking, not as his primary damage source.
>
> **Roleplaying Doom:** Doom refers to himself in the third person. He never begs, never retreats without purpose, and considers mercy a gift he rarely bestows. Even in defeat, he maintains absolute dignity. His word, once given, is ironclad—and he expects lesser beings to show the same honor.
>
> **Scaling Down:** For a shorter encounter, ignore the mythic trait. Doom becomes a standard CR 25 solo boss. For lower-level parties (15–17), remove the mythic trait, reduce HP to 225, and limit spellcasting to 6th-level slots and below.
