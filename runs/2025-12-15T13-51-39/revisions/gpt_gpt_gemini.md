***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will and he can’t be disarmed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   **At will:** *fire bolt* (4d10), *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *detect magic*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Doomfist Strike or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (5d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no material components.

***Spell Turning.*** If Doom is targeted by a spell that targets only him and doesn’t affect an area, and he succeeds on the saving throw or the spell attack misses, Doom can use his reaction to force the spell to target the caster instead. The caster makes any saving throw against the spell, or the spell attack roll is rerolled against the caster.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Doomfist.*** Doom makes one Doomfist Strike attack.

***Arcane Gauntlet (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet Blast attack.
