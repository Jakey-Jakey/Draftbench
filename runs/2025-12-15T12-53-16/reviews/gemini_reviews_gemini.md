This is a fantastic concept for a high-tier boss. You have successfully captured the flavor of Doctor Doom—arrogant, technologically superior, and magically dominant. A party facing this entity would truly feel like they are fighting a "Campaign Ender."

However, to ensure this runs smoothly at a table (especially with the complexities of Tier 4 play), there are several mechanical clarifications, formatting tweaks, and balance considerations needed.

Here is a detailed review of the statblock.

### 1. Formatting and Conventions
*   **Skills:** "Technology" is not a standard 5e skill. While appropriate for a modern/sci-fi setting, in 5e structure, this is usually handled by `Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools)` or bundled into `Arcana`. If you are introducing a new skill, ensure the players know they can't roll it, or explain what skill they should use to contest it.
*   **Saving Throws:** The formatting of abilities like **Indomitable Ego** creates redundancy.
    *   *Critique:* **Magic Resistance** gives advantage on saves vs. spells. **Indomitable Ego** gives advantage on *all* INT, WIS, and CHA saves.
    *   *Fix:* You generally don't need both. **Indomitable Ego** is superior. I would remove Magic Resistance (reducing text bloat) and modify Indomitable Ego to read: *"Doom has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, as well as saving throws against spells and other magical effects."*
*   **The "Doombots" Stat Reference:** In **Summon Doombots**, you reference a *Helmed Horror* with *Eldritch Blast*. For ease of use at the table, just stating "Use the Helmed Horror statistics..." is fine, but adding a specific Spell Attack Bonus and Damage for the *Eldritch Blast* (presumably +11 to hit, 3 beams of 1d10+something) is helpful so the DM doesn't have to look up the Helmed Horror and then modify it on the fly.

### 2. Action Economy & "Bladesinger" Style
The **Multiattack** feature allows Doom to replace one attack with a use of **Spellcasting**. This is the most potent ability on the sheet.
*   **The Danger:** Level 17+ Wizards are limited by having one Action per turn. Doom can cast *Meteor Swarm* (Action) and *Arcane Gauntlet* (Action) in the same turn via Multiattack.
*   **Convention Check:** Usually, monsters with this feature (like the Lich in newer books) are limited to substituting "Cantrips" or "At-Will spells," not leveled spells.
*   **Recommendation:** If you want him to be able to cast a high-level Nuke and attack in the same round, keep it, but understand this pushes his offensive CR significantly higher. A safer balance is: *"He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting to cast an At-Will spell."* If you want him to throw big spells, he should use his main Action for that, and use Legendary Actions for damage output.

### 3. The Reaction: Techno-Magical Absorption
This interacts poorly with 5e rules definitions.
*   **The Issue:** You specify "spell that deals damage or includes a magical energy attack (such as a dragon's breath weapon)."
    *   In 5e RAW (Rules As Written), a Dragon's Breath Weapon is **not** magical. It is a biological ability. *Antimagic Field* does not stop a Red Dragon's breath.
    *   Furthermore, regaining HP equal to *half* the damage implies he still takes the other half? Or does he take 0 damage and heal for half the amount rolled?
*   **Balance:** Healing from an enemy's attack at no resource cost (other than a reaction) is extremely punishing to players. If a Paladin Smites him or a Wizard casts a 9th-level spell, Doom effectively negates their turn and buffs himself.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   *Clarify Wording:* "When Doom takes damage from a spell or a magical effect..."
    *   *Clarify Effect:* "...he takes no damage and instead regains hit points equal to the damage dealt" (System Shock style) OR "...he gains resistance to the damage and regains HP equal to damage taken."
    *   *Resource Cost:* This potentially needs a generic "Recharge 5-6" or a "3/Day" limit. Unlimited healing reaction against a party of casters makes him mathematically unkillable.

### 4. The Doombot Protocol
This is a very cool thematic element (the "it was a bot all along" trope), but the mechanics are risky for a Campaign Ender.
*   **The Coin Flip:** "Roll a d20. On a 11 or higher..."
    *   This means there is a 50% chance the final boss of the campaign dies anticlimactically, and a 50% chance the fight drags on. For a narrative climax, do not rely on a die roll.
*   **The Teleport:** "Teleports to a space within 300 feet... with half his hit points."
    *   If Doom teleports 300 feet away (and possibly through walls/floors), the encounter breaks. The melee fighters have to dash for 3-4 rounds to reach him while he *Meteor Swarms* them.
*   **Recommendation:** Make this a **Mythic Trait** (ala *Theros* or *Fizban's*).
    *   *Mythic Wording:* "When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, his armor explodes [insert damage], revealing the chassis of a high-tier Doombot. The true Victor Von Doom teleports into the space just occupied by the Doombot (cloaked until this moment). His HP resets to [Assume a number, e.g., 250], and he regains all expended spell slots."
    *   This guarantees the "Second Phase" happens, which is more fun for a boss fight.

### 5. Detailed Spellcasting Issues
*   **Counterspell At-Will:** Be careful. With +10 INT, his passive Counterspell check is huge. He can shut down a party of casters single-handedly. This is appropriate for Doom, but very frustrating for players.
*   **No Components:** Ignoring Verbal and Somatic components means his spells usually **cannot be Counterspelled** by the players (Xanathar’s Guide to Everything rules imply you must perceive the casting to reaction-counter it). If players cannot Counterspell his *Meteor Swarm*, a TPK is highly likely on turn 1.
    *   *Fix:* Perhaps give him "Subtle Spell" mechanics (sorcery points) or just acknowledge that this makes him incredibly deadly.

### 6. Power Level & CR Calculations
Let's check the Challenge Rating.
*   **Defensive:** 333 HP is actually low for CR 24 (The Tarrasque has 676; Ancient Red Dragon has 546). **However**, with AC 22 + Shield (AC 27) + Heal-on-Reaction + 4 Legendary Resistances, his "Effective HP" is extremely high.
*   **Offensive:**
    *   Round 1: *Meteor Swarm* (avg 140 dmg x 4 targets) + Gauntlet (41 dmg) + 3 Legendary Gauntlets (123 dmg).
    *   That is an opening round of ~700+ damage spread across a party. This is definitely CR 24-26 territory.
*   **Verdict:** The CR 24 label is accurate, perhaps even conservative. He hits like a truck and is hard to hit.

### 7. Minor Adjustments
*   **Molecular Disruption:** "Paralyzed until the end of its next turn." This is a death sentence with his gauntlets. It’s good, but very lethal.
*   **Kneel Before Doom:** "Immediately end their turn."
    *   In 5e, forcing a turn to end "immediately" creates rules headaches (What happens to "start of turn" effects? Do they get a save at the end of the turn?).
    *   *Better phrasing:* "...fall prone and become Incapacitated until the start of their next turn." This achieves the same "loss of turn" effect using standard conditions.

### Final Polish Suggestion
Here is a revised version of the problematic features for better gameplay flow:

> **Reaction: Techno-Magical Siphon (Recharges 5-6).** When Doom is subjected to lightning damage, force damage, or damage from a spell, he can use his reaction to activate his armor's siphon. He takes no damage from the attack, and instead gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.
> *(Changing it to Temp HP prevents infinite healing abuse but keeps him tanky).*

> **Mythic Trait: The Doom of Latveria.** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die from the damage. instead, the current body is revealed to be a **Doombot**, which explodes. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) lightning damage on a failure or half on a success. The true Doctor Doom then appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet (having been utilizing a cloaking device), with 333 hit points. He immediately recharges **Molecular Disruption** and acts on his current initiative count.

> **Revised Multiattack.** Doom makes two Arcane Gauntlet attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting to cast an At-Will spell.

### Summary
This statblock is terrifying and oozes flavor. Victor Von Doom feels like a master of magic and technology. With the tweaks to the **Doombot Protocol** (making it guaranteed rather than random) and the **Reaction** (balancing the healing), this will be a memorable encounter. Watch out for the interaction between his *Component-less casting* and player *Counterspells*—that is the specific mechanic that will likely cause the most table arguments
