***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor grants the following benefits: his AC includes his Intelligence modifier, he can breathe in any environment including vacuum, he is immune to disease, and he has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will.

***Mythic Awakening: The Real Doom (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, his current armor creates a catastrophic shockwave—this was merely a Doombot. Each creature within 20 feet of him must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The true Doom then teleports into an unoccupied space within 120 feet of the destroyed chassis, regaining 300 hit points and resetting all cooldowns (including *Legendary Resistance*).

***Indomitable Will.*** If Doom succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or having his mind read or controlled, the creature that forced the save takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Supreme Intellect.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom analyzes a creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the start of Doom's next turn, he has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Doom's spells and abilities.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, prestidigitation*
1st–3rd level (at will): *detect magic, dispel magic, mirror image*
4th level (3 slots): *dimension door, greater invisibility, wall of fire*
5th level (3 slots): *cone of cold, telekinesis, wall of force*
6th level (1 slot): *globe of invulnerability*
7th level (1 slot): *forcecage, plane shift, teleport*
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, power word stun*
9th level (1 slot): *power word kill, time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks: any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (4d10 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of arcane devastation. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 81 (18d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 55 (10d10) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 2 **Doombots** in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act on his initiative, obey his commands, and last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Energy Shield (3/Day).*** Doom gains resistance to all damage until the start of his next turn.

### Reactions

***Technomagical Shield.*** When Doom is hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell, he creates a barrier of force. He gains +5 to AC until the start of his next turn, including against the triggering attack. Additionally, if Doom is forced to make a saving throw, he can use his reaction to add +5 to the roll.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Teleport.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list.
**Arcane Annihilation (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.

---

## LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action while in Castle Doom to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombots.** Two **Doombots** emerge from hidden alcoves within 60 feet of Doom.
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) force damage on a failure, or half on a success.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors and passages seal shut (AC 20, 100 HP, immune to poison and psychic damage). Doom can open any sealed door at will.
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point within 120 feet. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.
