  "reasoning": "claude_claude leads with exceptional balance fixes (Shield 3/day, Arcane Supremacy 3/day, Servo-Guard cap), comprehensive DM guidance, party composition adjustments, and clean 5e formatting. gpt_gpt excels with streamlined design, excellent counterplay mechanics (Break the Shackles), and sensible AC 20. gpt_claude offers solid traditional spellcasting with smart Time Stop limitations. gemini_claude has proper mythic structure but Mind Transfer raises concerns. claude_gpt regresses by keeping Shield at-will and 90-ft cone. gpt_gemini is clean but Recharge on defensive reaction is unusual. gemini_gpt has good ideas but non-standard 'Technology' skill hurts formatting. gemini_gemini is overtuned with DC 26, +18 to hit, and 1d4 Helmed Horrors per lair action creating massive action economy issues. claude_gemini ranks last due to unlimited counterspell, -10 damage reduction stacking with crit immunity, and 77 damage Molecular Expulsion creating severe balance problems."
