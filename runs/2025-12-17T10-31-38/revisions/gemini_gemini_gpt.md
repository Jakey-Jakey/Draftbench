***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 30 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he is immune to the stunned condition.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components for his spells. Additionally, when Doom casts a spell that requires concentration, he can choose to maintain concentration on a previous spell as well (up to a maximum of two spells at once). If he takes damage while concentrating on two spells, he makes a single Constitution saving throw to maintain both spells. While Doom is concentrating on two spells, he can’t take legendary actions.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

* **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, prestidigitation, word of radiance*
* **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
* **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
* **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*
* **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
* **5th level (3 slots):** *synaptic static, telekinesis, wall of force*
* **6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
* **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, teleport*
* **8th level (1 slot):** *mind blank* (active)
* **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two Gauntlet Blast attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting (cantrip only).

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

## Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom can use his reaction to attempt to siphon its energy. Doom makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect, and Doom regains one expended spell slot of a level equal to or lower than the level of the spell that was cast.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Tactical Reposition.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells.

***Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational dominance. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) force damage, is knocked prone, and is restrained (escape DC 25) until the start of Doom’s next turn. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against the escape DC, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or restrained. The effect also ends early if Doom is incapacitated.
