___

***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor has an AC of 13 + his Intelligence modifier (included in AC). While wearing the armor, Doom can breathe in any environment including vacuum, is immune to disease, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will.

***Indomitable Will.*** When a creature attempts to charm or frighten Doom, read his thoughts, or magically control his actions, that creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Supreme Intellect.*** Doom can use a bonus action to analyze a creature he can see within 60 feet. The target is marked until Doom marks a different creature or until the end of Doom's next turn. Doom has advantage on attack rolls against the marked creature, and the marked creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Doom's spells and abilities.

***Arrogant Monologue.*** The first time each round that Doom reduces a creature to 0 hit points, he must either spend one legendary action to gloat (which has no other effect) or lose one legendary action at the start of his next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks):

At will: *detect magic*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*
3/day each: *counterspell*, *dimension door*, *dispel magic*, *hold monster*, *lightning bolt*, *mirror image*, *misty step*
2/day each: *chain lightning*, *disintegrate*, *forcecage*, *wall of force*
1/day each: *dominate monster*, *plane shift*, *power word stun*, *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of magnetic force. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 54 (12d8) force damage and is pushed up to 30 feet away from Doom. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't pushed.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 55 (10d10) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 2 **Doombots** in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act on his initiative, obey his commands, and last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Energy Shield (3/Day).*** Doom gains 45 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute.

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack he can see, he adds +5 to his AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.

***Retributive Strike (3/Day).*** When a creature within 60 feet deals damage to Doom, he forces it to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure, or half on a success.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Analyze.** Doom uses Supreme Intellect.
**Teleport.** Doom uses Tactical Repositioning.
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts *counterspell*, *dimension door*, *dispel magic*, *lightning bolt*, *mirror image*, or *misty step*.
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn. A successful save halves the damage with no stun.

## MYTHIC TRAIT

***Victor's Contingency.*** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, he regains 168 hit points, and his armor crackles with renewed power. Doom regains all uses of Legendary Resistance and Energy Shield. For the next hour, he deals an additional 9 (2d8) lightning damage with his Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt attacks.

If Doom's mythic trait activates, he can use the options below as legendary actions for 1 hour after it activates.

**Doom's Wrath (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom uses Doom Blast if it is available, or makes one Gauntlet Strike.
**Protocol Override (Costs 2 Actions).** Each Doombot within 120 feet of Doom can use its reaction to make one attack.

If the characters defeat Doom after his mythic trait activates, they earn XP as if they had defeated two CR 25 creatures (150,000 XP total).

---

## LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take a lair action while in Castle Doom to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombot.** One **Doombot** emerges from a hidden alcove in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom.
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failure, or half on a success.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors and passages within 120 feet seal shut (AC 18, 50 HP, immune to poison and psychic damage). Doom can open or close any sealed door at will (no action required).
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Doom can see within 120 feet fills with disorienting energy. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.

***False Appearance.*** While motionless, a Doombot appears identical to a humanoid wearing Doom's armor. A creature can use an action to examine the Doombot and determine it is a construct with a successful DC 18 Investigation check.

***Self-Destruct.*** When the Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Doombot makes two Gauntlet Strike attacks.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (4d6 + 2) force damage.

### Reactions

***Shield (3/Day).*** When the Doombot is hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell, it magically creates a barrier, gaining a +5 bonus to AC (including against the triggering attack) and immunity to *magic missile*. This benefit lasts until the start of the Doombot's next turn.
