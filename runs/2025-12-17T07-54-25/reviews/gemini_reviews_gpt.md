Here is a comprehensive review of the **Doctor Doom** statblock.

### **Overview**
This is a very strong, thematic "Final Boss" statblock. You have successfully captured the essence of Doom: a character who blends supreme magical ability with technological genius and unshakeable arrogance. 

At **CR 23**, he is comparable to Demon Lords (Juiblex, Zuggtmoy) or Ancient Dragons. However, his defensive layering is currently overtuned to the point where he may be mathematically frustrating rather than challenging to fight.

---

### **1. Formatting & Conventions**
*   **Ability Scores & Proficiency:** The math is clean. PB +7 is correct for CR 23. Skills and Saves are calculated correctly based on stats + proficiency.
*   **Skill Expertise:** Giving him explicit expertise (+14 to +20) in Arcana is very appropriate for Doom.
*   **Formatting Nuances:**
    *   *Spellcasting:* Standard 5e separates "at will" spells from the leveled list usually with a "Innate Spellcasting" trait or keeps them in the main list. Your format is readable, but "Cantrips (at will)" is the standard header.
    *   *Attack block:* "Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4)..." is perfectly formatted.

### **2. Thematic Representation**
*   **Master of Magic and Machine:** Excellent trait. It prevents him from being walled by elemental immunities, which fits his intellect—he always has a gadget or spell modification ready.
*   **Doom Armor:** "Can't be removed against his will" is a nice ribbon feature.
*   **Spell Selection:** *Time Stop, Meteor Swarm, Forcecage, Globe of Invulnerability.* These are perfect spells for a Wizard-King archetype.

### **3. Mechanical Balance & Gameplay Issues**

#### **A. The "Untouchable" Problem (Major Issue)**
Doom currently possesses a layering of defenses that might make the combat unfun rather than difficult:
1.  **AC 21** (High base)
2.  **Shield Spell** (Reaction to hit AC 26)
3.  **Force Field Matrix** (20 THP every turn)
4.  **Redirective Shielding** (Reaction to reduce damage by 25)
5.  **Legendary Resistance**

**The Conflict:** He has two primary Reactions (*Shield* spell and *Redirective Shielding*). In 5e, a creature only gets **one Reaction per round**.
*   If he casts *Shield*, he cannot use *Redirective Shielding*.
*   If he uses *Redirective Shielding*, he cannot cast *Counterspell* or *Shield*.
*   **Actionable Fix:** This is actually a good restriction, but the *Redirective Shielding* flat reduction (-25) is frustratingly high for multi-attack classes (Monks, dual wielders) who rely on many small hits. It effectively negates their turn.

#### **B. Action Economy & The Doombots**
*   **Summon Doombots:** You are summoning 2d4 (avg 5) **Helmed Horrors** (CR 4 each).
    *   Summoning 5 CR 4 creatures adds roughly 200 HP and 15 attacks to the board immediately. This clogs initiative and drastically swings the CR.
    *   **Issue:** Helmed Horrors are immune to *Force, Necrotic, and Poison*, and have spell immunities. Tracking this for 5 minions plus Doom is a nightmare for the DM.
    *   **Suggestion:** Change this to a fixed number (e.g., "3 Doombots") or create a specialized, simplified "Doombot" statblock (Minion style: 1 HP, fixed damage) to reduce cognitive load.

#### **C. Concentration & Saves**
*   **Constitution:** +14 Save.
*   **Force Field:** Gives Advantage on Concentration.
*   *Result:* Doom will mathematically **never** lose concentration. To break his concentration, players must deal roughly 30+ damage in a single hit just to force a roll that he might fail (DC 15 is an auto-success for him on a 1).
*   *Verdict:* This makes spells like *Maze* or *Globe of Invulnerability* devastatingly permanent until dispelled.

### **4. Detailed Action Critiques**

*   **Gauntlet Blast:** 33 force damage is solid. Adding 2d10 vs metal is a great thematic touch (magnetism/technology).
*   **Arcane Pulse:** Standard breath-weapon style AoE. Good "get off me" tool.
*   **Legendary Actions:**
    *   *Cantrip:* Standard.
    *   *Warp Step:* Essential for a boss to avoid being surrounded.
    *   *Overclocked Casting (2 actions):* This is the scariest ability. Casting a *Fireball* or *Dispel Magic* on someone else's turn is very strong but appropriate for CR 23.
    *   *Force Field Surge:* Healing 40 THP for 2 legendary actions is weak compared to dealing ~66 damage with 2 Gauntlet Blasts. He will rarely use this unless he has nothing to shoot.

### **Recommended Revisions**

Here are specific changes to polish the statblock for better playability and balance:

**1. Tweak "Redirective Shielding" (Reaction)**
The flat 25 reduction is clunky. Change it to a mechanic that feels more interactive or strictly magical.
> **Revised:** *When Doom takes damage from a creature he can see within 60 feet, he activates his deflective sensors. He takes half damage from that attack, and the attacker takes lightning damage equal to the damage Doom took (maximum 20).*
> *(This simplifies the math to "Halve it" rather than "Subtract 25" and punishes the attacker without negating the hit entirely.)*

**2. Adjust "Summon Doombots"**
Reduce the variance and complexity.
> **Revised:** *Doom summons **2** constructs that use the **Helmed Horror** statblock but have 30 hit points. (Reducing their HP acts as a minion mechanic so players can cleave through them, rather than slogging through 60hp chunks).*

**3. Adjust Spell List**
Doom has too many concentration spells that clog his strategy. He is better off blasting or controlling the field with non-concentration effects because *Globe of Invulnerability* or *Greater Invisibility* are his best concentration options.
*   *Add:* **Steel Wind Strike** (XGtE) - Very thematic for Doom (fast melee strikes).
*   *Add:* **Bigby's Hand** (fitting for his ego).

**4. Clarify "Eldritch Blast"**
Eldritch Blast is a Warlock cantrip (CHA), but Doom casts with INT.
*   **Fix:** Just rename it to **Arcane Blast** or add a parenthetical note in the Spellcasting trait: *(Doom casts warlock spells using Intelligence)*.

**5. Defensive Calculation Adjustment**
Currently, between *Shield* (Reaction), *Counterspell* (Reaction), and *Redirective Shielding* (Reaction), Doom has too much competition for his Reaction.
*   **Suggestion:** Move the **Force Field Matrix** (THP regen) to the start of his turn (as written) but **increase it to 30**. Remove the Reaction damage reduction ability entirely. This speeds up play. If you keep the Reaction, make it purely offensive (Retribution damage) effectively functioning like a *Hellish Rebuke* that pushes people back.

### **Final Verdict**
**Status:** **High Quality / Playable with tweaks.**
The statblock is frightening and flavorful. However, without adjusting the **Summon Doombots** quantity and the heavy damage reduction mechanics, the fight risks becoming a slog where the players feel their turns don't matter.

**Adjusted CR:** With the statblock *exactly* as written (assuming 5 Helmed Horrors and optimal play), he is closer to **CR 25**. If you limit the Doombots to 2 or 3, he settles nicely into **CR 23**.
