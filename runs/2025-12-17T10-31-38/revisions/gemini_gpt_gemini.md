***Doombot Contingency (1/Day).*** When Doom drops to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point and teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. He leaves behind an inert Doombot shell in his previous space that is destroyed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Blank.*** Doom is permanently under the effects of the *mind blank* spell. He is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would read his emotions or thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 20 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he has advantage on saving throws against the Stunned condition.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components for his spells. Additionally, Doom can maintain concentration on two spells at once. While concentrating on two spells, he makes Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration with disadvantage. On a failure, he loses concentration on both spells.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom understands all spoken languages and can speak any language he has heard for at least 1 minute.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *eldritch blast (4 beams), mage hand, word of radiance, prestidigitation*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
*   5th level (3 slots): *scrying, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, teleport*
*   8th level (1 slot): *mind blank* (active)
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two Gauntlet Blast attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of a Cantrip.

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom can use his reaction to mimic the effect of a *counterspell* (cast at 5th level). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom absorbs the energy and regains one expended spell slot of 5th level or lower.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Tactical Reposition.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
***Gauntlet Blast.*** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.
***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells.
***Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational and psychic dominance. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage and is knocked prone. The creature is then grappled by their own weight (escape DC 21) until the start of Doom's next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and is not prone or grappled.
