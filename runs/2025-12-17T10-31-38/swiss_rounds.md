# Swiss Tournament Log (1v1v1)

## Round 1

- **1st: gpt_gemini_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gemini
  - *S1 offers the most complete and balanced design with properly implemented mythic/lair actions and better CR-appropriate damage, while S3 improves on S2 by adding crucial limitations to dual concentration (no legendary actions while doing so) and clearer duration wording, whereas S2's unrestricted dual concentration and DC 25 saves make it mechanically overpowered for its CR.*
- **1st: claude_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gemini_claude_claude
  - *S3 is the most complete package with proper CR 25 math, lair actions, Doombot statblock, excellent action economy spread across all action types, and the cleanest 5e formatting; S1 is solid with good balance and thematic abilities but has minor issues like a missing 8th-level slot and non-standard skill; S2 has mechanical errors including wrong proficiency bonus for CR 27, inconsistent spell save DC calculation, awkward conditional mechanics on Diplomatic Immunity, and unusual force immunity that inflates CR.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gpt_claude | 3rd: gpt_gpt_gpt
  - *S1 offers the best balance of CR-appropriate mechanics, streamlined modern 5e spellcasting, and playability; S3 has excellent thematic content (Doombots, Arrogant Monologue flaw) but is overtuned with DC 25 saves and too many condition immunities; S2 uses outdated traditional spell slot design that adds complexity without payoff and has weaker multiattack output for its CR.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gemini** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_claude | 3rd: gemini_claude_gemini
  - *S1 has the cleanest modern 5e formatting, appropriate CR 25 math, complete mythic/lair features, and well-organized reactions; S3 is mechanically solid but its CR 23 is underestimated for 345 HP and extensive immunities; S2 has a critical skill math error (Arcana +26 is impossible), lacks lair actions, and its CR 27 is inflated relative to its two-attack multiattack damage output.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gemini_claude
  - *S1 offers the best mechanical balance with proper CR-appropriate damage, standard 5e formatting, and well-designed mythic mechanics; S2 has excellent thematic elements (Doombot reveal, included minion statblock) but is significantly overtuned with at-will 3rd-level spells, constant advantage via Supreme Intellect, and an overpowered reaction; S3 breaks fundamental 5e design rules with dual concentration, includes a non-standard skill (Technology), uses an incorrect cantrip (word of radiance is cleric-only), and grants rare force immunity.*
- **1st: claude_claude_claude** | 2nd: claude_gpt_gemini | 3rd: gpt_claude_claude
  - *S1 is the most complete package with excellent thematic depth (regional effects, Doombot Contingency decoy mechanic, full lair), proper 5e formatting, and comprehensive spellcasting befitting Doom's magical mastery; S3 is well-balanced with clean mythic integration and good playability but lacks regional effects; S2, while mechanically sound, misses key thematic elements (no Doombot statblock, situational Master of Machines, out-of-character telepathy) and lacks regional effects.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gemini_claude | 3rd: gemini_gpt_claude
  - *S2 offers the cleanest design with automatic Supreme Intellect, an elegant dual-mode reaction, and excellent formatting; S1 is nearly as strong but introduces complexity with two separate reactions per turn; S3 is notably incomplete, lacking lair actions and a Doombot statblock, while its traditional spell slot system and weaker Doombot Contingency fail to capture Doom's mythic threat level.*
- **1st: gpt_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: claude_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gpt_gemini
  - *S1 offers the best balance of mechanical soundness, proper 5e formatting, and accurate CR with its well-designed mythic trait system; S3 provides excellent thematic content and useful Doombot inclusion but suffers from overly high DCs and inconsistent lair action scaling; S2 breaks core 5e conventions with non-wizard cantrips (eldritch blast, word of radiance), dual concentration, and a nonexistent skill (Technology).*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_claude | 3rd: gemini_claude_gpt
  - *S2 excels with accurate CR 25 math, streamlined at-will/per-day spellcasting, excellent Doombot integration with full statblock, and clean 5e formatting; S1 is mechanically sound for CR 23 with creative mythic trait and solid lair actions but is more complex to run; S3 has inflated CR 27 that doesn't match its 2-attack multiattack, contains a skill calculation error (Arcana +24 is mathematically impossible), and lacks iconic Doombot theming.*

## Round 2

- **1st: claude_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_claude | 3rd: claude_gemini_claude
  - *S1 offers the best balance with creative limitations (Arrogant Monologue), accurate CR 25 math, complete Doombot stats, and excellent thematic representation; S2 is mechanically sound but uses harder-to-run traditional spell slots and lacks Doombot stats; S3 has serious balance issues including unlimited reactions (Technomagical Shield, Retributive Strike), significantly inflated damage values, and a broken mythic action that bypasses daily spell limits entirely.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gemini_gpt | 3rd: gpt_claude_gpt
  - *S1 offers the most balanced design with appropriate CR 25 DCs, clean 5e formatting, optional Doombot contingency for DM flexibility, and well-tuned resource management; S2 has strong flavor but is over-tuned with unlimited Technomagical Shield reactions and 81-damage cone attacks; S3 is under-tuned with DC 22 saves (too low for CR 25), missing Doombot statblock, and the overly situational Master of Machines ability.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gpt_gpt_gemini
  - *S3 has the clearest formatting (bullet-pointed Master of Machines, explicit mythic action header) while maintaining appropriate CR 23 power with three-attack multiattack and thematic condition immunities; S2 is nearly identical but with slightly less polished formatting; S1 falls behind with lower damage output (two attacks vs three), an unconventional separate mythic action pool that complicates play, and less thematic features like limited condition immunities and meteor swarm instead of the more Doom-appropriate time stop.*
- **1st: claude_claude_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gpt | 3rd: claude_gemini_gemini
  - *S3 offers the best balance with reasonable HP (337+168 contingency), proper spell slot formatting, bonus action economy for Supreme Intellect, and complete Doombot/lair content; S1 has creative dual-concentration mechanics but lacks Doombots entirely and uses non-standard skills; S2 is significantly overtuned with 750+ effective HP from mythic, at-will 3rd-level spells, and an overloaded reaction covering both attacks and saves, making it play far above CR 25.*
- **1st: gemini_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gpt_gemini
  - *S2 has the clearest wording (especially for Kneel Before Doom's duration and escape mechanics), while S1 is nearly identical but slightly less precise; S3 has interesting additions like Doombot Contingency but contains errors including backward skill formatting, inappropriately granting the warlock-exclusive eldritch blast cantrip, and a damage calculation error (+10 damage with only +9 INT modifier).*
- **1st: gemini_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gemini_claude_gpt
  - *S2 offers the best mechanical balance with appropriately restrained legendary action spellcasting (3rd level cap), accurate CR 24 rating, and creative but balanced features like dual concentration with meaningful drawbacks; S3 excels in thematic representation with mythic traits and lair actions following modern 5e boss design, but its complexity and the mythic phase effectively doubling the encounter makes CR assessment harder; S1 is overtuned with 5th-level legendary action spellcasting, 30 temp HP per turn, and questionable skill bonuses (+24 Arcana exceeds normal calculations), making its CR 27 potentially still undervalued.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_claude** | 2nd: gemini_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_claude_claude
  - *S2 features the most polished modern 5e design with correct CR 25 math, streamlined at-will/per-day spellcasting, proper mythic traits with lair actions, and superior playability, while S3 corrects S1's proficiency bonus error (+8 vs +7) but both S1 and S3 have spell attack calculation issues and lack the completeness of S2's mythic and lair content.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gpt_gemini_claude
  - *S2 offers the most complete package with a well-implemented mythic trait, Doombot companion statblock, and detailed lair actions that capture Doom's character brilliantly; S1 has cleaner traditional 5e formatting and balanced mechanics despite missing 8th-level spells and lacking lair/mythic features; S3 has good content but suffers from non-standard formatting, overloaded condition immunities, and the highest Unibeam damage (72) feels excessive even for CR 23.*
- **1st: claude_claude_gpt** | 2nd: claude_claude_claude | 3rd: gpt_claude_gemini
  - *S3 is a refined version of S1 with crucial improvements (Supreme Intellect cooldown, Doombot summoning cap, cleaner Doom Armor wording), while S2, despite its innovative mythic trait and streamlined spellcasting, lacks the Doombot statblock entirely, omits regional effects, and cannot summon Doombots—significant thematic gaps for Doctor Doom.*

## Round 3

- **1st: gemini_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_claude_claude | 3rd: gemini_gpt_gemini
  - *S1 has correct proficiency bonus (+8 for CR 27), clean formatting, and balanced mechanics; S2 has creative flavor features but uses incorrect proficiency (+7 instead of +8 for CR 27); S3 has multiple errors including non-wizard cantrips (eldritch blast, word of radiance), a made-up skill (Intelligence Technology), and potentially broken dual concentration.*
- **1st: gemini_claude_gemini** | 2nd: claude_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gemini
  - *S1 offers the best mechanical balance with appropriate limitations (3/day Power Siphon, balanced multiattack), accurate CR 27 assessment, and excellent thematic flavor including the Supreme Arrogance weakness; S2 is creative with its brilliant Doombot mythic mechanic and comprehensive lair/minion package but is significantly overtuned for CR 25 (at-will 1st-3rd level spells, 750 effective HP, overpowered reaction); S3 has fundamental design flaws including dual concentration which breaks core 5e mechanics, an unlimited Power Siphon that removes player agency, a non-standard 'Technology' skill, and includes word of radiance (a cleric cantrip) on a wizard spell list.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_claude** | 2nd: claude_gemini_gpt | 3rd: claude_claude_claude
  - *S2 excels with the brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' weakness that balances power with thematic flavor, cleaner mythic implementation, and tighter mechanical balance; S1 is well-formatted with excellent thematic elements but is slightly overtuned with 450+300 HP; S3 suffers from traditional spell slot complexity, an apparently unlimited Retributive Strike reaction, and an overpowered Energy Shield bonus action despite nice Regional Effects.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gpt | 3rd: claude_gemini_claude
  - *S1 offers the best balance with appropriate CR 23 numbers (DC 22, 3-attack multiattack, well-costed mythic actions), while S3 is slightly undertuned (only 2 attacks, DC 21); S2, despite creative Doombot mechanics, is significantly overtuned with DC 25 saves, +17 attack bonuses, and the broken Arcane Supremacy mythic action that grants free casts of power word kill.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_gemini | 3rd: claude_claude_gemini
  - *S1 offers the cleanest 5e formatting with well-balanced mythic mechanics and streamlined spellcasting; S2 has strong thematic elements like Master of Machines but is more complex to run with full spell slots; S3 has significant balance issues including inconsistent DCs (25 vs 18 on lair actions), unlimited Retributive Strike reactions, and potentially game-breaking mass Doombot summoning.*
- **1st: gpt_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gemini_claude
  - *S1 is the most mechanically sound with correct skill math, proper 5e formatting, comprehensive features (lair actions, mythic trait), and avoids broken mechanics like dual concentration; S3 improves on S2 by adding the critical restriction that dual concentration disables legendary actions plus better escape DC notation and end conditions; S2 has unrestricted dual concentration making it overpowered, missing 'can see' clauses, and incorrect skill bonuses.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gpt_claude_claude
  - *S2 has correct CR 25 math, modern innate spellcasting format, properly structured mythic trait with mythic actions, multiple well-designed reactions, and complete lair actions; S1 is creative with unique features like Power Siphon and Kneel Before Doom but includes non-wizard cantrips (eldritch blast, word of radiance), a non-standard skill, and is missing 8th-level spell slots; S3 is nearly identical to S2 but has systematic proficiency bonus errors throughout (using +7 instead of +8), causing all saves, DCs, attack bonuses, and skill checks to be incorrect.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: claude_claude_gpt | 3rd: gpt_gemini_gpt
  - *S1 has the cleanest modern 5e formatting with properly limited abilities (3/day reactions, balanced spell uses), complete Doombot support, and excellent thematic execution; S3 is very similar but has balance issues including an unlimited Retributive Strike reaction and inconsistent lair action DCs (18 vs 25); S2, while featuring an interesting mythic phase, lacks a Doombot statblock entirely—a critical omission for Doctor Doom—and uses 'repulsor' terminology that feels more Iron Man than Doom.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_claude | 3rd: gpt_gpt_claude
  - *S2 offers the cleanest modern 5e design with properly implemented mythic trait, streamlined innate spellcasting for easier play, well-balanced damage output, and valuable lair actions; S1 has more unique thematic features (Scientific Sorcery, Doombot Contingency, 'Kneel Before Doom') but contains a math error (+22 Arcana is impossible) and dual concentration risks balance issues; S3 is a less polished version of S2 with a non-standard mythic action system (1 separate action vs. additional legendary actions) that weakens its mythic phase and adds confusion.*

## Round 4

- **1st: gpt_claude_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gemini_claude
  - *S1 uses clean modern innate spellcasting, proper mythic formatting, and CR-appropriate DCs with balanced three-attack multiattack; S2 is solid but uses outdated spell slot tracking and only two attacks; S3 has broken mechanics (dual concentration, 30 temp HP/turn, spell absorption reaction), invalid skills (+24 Arcana, made-up Technology skill), and an inappropriately high DC 25 that violate 5e design principles.*
- **1st: gpt_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gemini | 3rd: gemini_claude_claude
  - *S3 demonstrates the most professional 5e design with proper mythic trait formatting, lair actions, balanced recharge abilities, and accurate CR calculation, while S1 is solid but includes errors like eldritch blast on a wizard spell list and a non-standard 'Intelligence (Technology)' skill, and S2 has an inflated CR 27 that doesn't match its actual threat level, an excessive INT 30, and confusing mechanics like the Diplomatic Immunity restriction.*
- **1st: claude_claude_claude** | 2nd: claude_claude_gemini | 3rd: gpt_gemini_claude
  - *S3 is the most complete package with proper 5e formatting, included Doombot statblock, regional effects for worldbuilding, and important clarifications (reaction limit, concentration restriction on legendary spell casting); S2 is nearly identical but lacks regional effects and minor refinements; S1 has creative mythic mechanics but uses non-standard formatting, has excessive condition immunities (stunned, paralyzed), and potential CR inaccuracy given its mythic trait.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gpt
  - *S1 excels with proper mythic trait/action implementation, thematic lair actions, and balanced mechanics at an accurate CR 23; S2 is solid but has skill calculation errors (Arcana +26 is impossible) and lacks lair actions; S3 is weakest due to an unlimited Power Siphon that breaks action economy, a non-existent 'Technology' skill, an off-list cantrip (word of radiance), and the dual-concentration mechanic which violates core 5e design.*
- **1st: gemini_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gpt | 3rd: claude_gemini_gemini
  - *S3 has the cleanest 5e formatting with proper spell slot progression (including 8th level), standard wizard cantrips, and a well-balanced dual concentration mechanic with clear restrictions; S1 is similar but has issues like missing 8th-level slot, non-standard eldritch blast on a wizard, and a fake 'Intelligence (Technology)' skill; S2 is thematically strong but mechanically overtuned with at-will leveled spells breaking wizard conventions, a mythic phase that resets ALL cooldowns making effective HP around 750, and an overpowered Technomagical Shield reaction.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gemini_claude_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gemini
  - *S3 excels with its mythic trait, Doombot mechanics, lair actions, and modern innate spellcasting format that masterfully capture Doom's character; S1 is mechanically sound and well-balanced with clean traditional formatting; S2 has fundamental issues including a game-breaking dual concentration feature, a non-existent 'Technology' skill, an incorrect spell (word of radiance is cleric-only), and an overpowered Power Siphon that nearly auto-succeeds.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gpt_claude | 3rd: claude_gpt_gemini
  - *S1 is the most complete with proper formatting, optional Doombot contingency for DM flexibility, comprehensive spell list, and correct terminology throughout; S3 has creative flavor (Arrogant Monologue) and clean formatting but lacks nonmagical BPS resistance; S2 has formatting errors ('electric damage' instead of lightning), an odd AC calculation formula, and less flexible mythic implementation.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_claude_gemini | 3rd: gpt_gpt_gemini
  - *S2 excels with modern simplified spellcasting, CR-appropriate stats (450 HP for CR 25), a creative Doombot mythic trait, included minion statblock, and tactical Supreme Intellect feature; S3 improves on S1 with modern design elements (bonus action, multiple reaction options, 3-attack multiattack) but its CR 25 rating is undermined by CR 23-level defenses (345 HP, AC 21); S1 has internally consistent CR 23 stats but suffers from complex full spellcasting that reduces playability and only 2 attacks per multiattack.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gpt** | 2nd: claude_claude_gpt | 3rd: gpt_gemini_gemini
  - *S3 uses modern 5e innate spellcasting format with appropriate DCs for CR 25, has the cleanest mythic integration, and correct proficiency bonus alignment; S2 offers creative Doombot mechanics and included minion statblock but has overtuned DC 25 saves that exceed 5e standards; S1 is solid but uses older spell slot formatting, has a potentially undervalued CR 23, and lacks S3's refinements.*

## Round 5

- **1st: gpt_claude_gemini** | 2nd: claude_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gpt_claude
  - *S1 offers the best balance with a well-implemented mythic trait, clean modern 5e formatting, and streamlined playability; S2 excels with its Doombot statblock and thematic mechanics but risks overwhelming complexity with excessive spell options and multiple tracked resources; S3 uses outdated traditional spellcaster formatting, has a potential skill error (+22 Arcana), and the dual concentration mechanic creates problematic balance issues.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_claude | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gemini
  - *S1 offers the most comprehensive and thematically rich design with proper mythic formatting, lair actions, Doombot companions, and abilities that distinctly capture Doctor Doom's character; S2 and S3 are nearly identical but S2 has clearer wording on the restrained effect in Kneel Before Doom, while S3's escape clause awkwardly mixes with the save result text.*
- **1st: gpt_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_claude_claude | 3rd: claude_gemini_gemini
  - *S1 demonstrates the best balance with accurate CR 23 math, clean 5e formatting, well-designed mythic mechanics, and proper recharge abilities; S3 has creative thematic features like Supreme Arrogance but contains calculation errors (Arcana +24 is wrong) and an inflated CR 27; S2 is overtuned with at-will 1st-3rd level spells, excessive stats (INT 28, CON 26), DC 25 saves, and a mythic trait that resets Legendary Resistance which breaks bounded accuracy.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_claude_gemini
  - *S3 excels with its iconic Doombot Protocol mythic trait, included Doombot statblock, comprehensive lair actions, and modern simplified spellcasting format; S1 is mechanically solid with accurate CR 23 and good tech-magic balance; S2 has a mathematical error (Arcana +26 is impossible), lacks lair actions inappropriate for a villain of this stature, and its CR 27 appears inflated given relatively low HP and only two attacks per multiattack.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_gpt | 3rd: claude_gpt_gemini
  - *S3 offers the best balance of mechanical soundness, modern 5e simplified spellcasting, and playability with refined damage values and reasonable condition immunities; S2 is solid but more complex with full spell slots and broader condition immunities (including stunned); S1 has creative thematic elements like the Doombot system but significant balance issues including at-will 3rd-level counterspell/shield that would frustrate caster players and an unusually high Constitution score.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gemini | 3rd: claude_claude_gpt
  - *S2 excels with modern simplified spellcasting, the brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' flaw trait, clean formatting, and includes a complete Doombot statblock; S1 is traditionally designed with solid mythic implementation despite full spell slots adding complexity; S3 has excellent thematic ideas like Doombot Contingency but suffers from unlimited Retributive Strike, inconsistent lair action DCs (18 vs 25), redundant rules text, and mechanically confusing retroactive Doombot reveals.*
- **1st: claude_claude_claude** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_claude | 3rd: gemini_gpt_gpt
  - *S3 offers the most complete package with lair actions, regional effects, and a Doombot statblock for playability, plus the iconic Doombot Contingency ability; S1 is well-balanced with proper mythic boss design and accurate CR 23 mechanics; S2 has notable formatting errors including a non-standard 'Intelligence (Technology)' skill, unexplained +23 skill bonuses, a missing 8th-level spell slot, and lacks both lair actions and regional effects.*
- **1st: gemini_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gpt | 3rd: gpt_gemini_claude
  - *S2 offers the best mechanical balance with its limited Power Siphon (3/day), elegant Doombot Contingency, and appropriately tuned force field, despite an eldritch blast error; S1 has cleaner formatting but its unlimited Power Siphon reaction is overpowered for CR 24; S3 is overly complex with mythic phases, has spell list errors (more spells than slots at several levels), and non-standard formatting that reduces playability.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_claude** | 2nd: claude_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_claude_gpt
  - *S1 offers the best balance of accurate CR 25 mechanics, proper 5e formatting, and thematic features like Master of Machines and mythic options; S3 excels thematically with Doombot Contingency and included Doombot statblock but is mechanically overtuned with an inappropriately high DC 25 and too many stacking defensive abilities; S2 is mechanically competent but critically lacks lair actions and Doombots—essential elements for Doctor Doom—while its force immunity and CR 27 rating feel inflated.*

## Round 6

- **1st: gpt_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gemini | 3rd: gpt_gpt_claude
  - *S2 has the cleanest 5e formatting with properly separated Mythic Spellcasting, explicit spell slot usage in Command the Arsenal, and balanced action economy; S1 is solid but slightly less polished; S3 has significant issues including three attacks in Multiattack (overtuned), 8th-level listing two spells for one slot, non-standard '7/Day' and '1/Round' mechanics, and an inconsistent spell attack bonus.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gpt_claude_claude | 3rd: gpt_gemini_gpt
  - *S1 excels with its thematic 'Arrogant Monologue' weakness, included Doombot statblock, and superior mechanical depth; S2 offers cleaner streamlined spellcasting and better-balanced mythic actions; S3 suffers from excessive condition immunities (including stunned) that reduce tactical interactivity and uses cumbersome slot-based casting inappropriate for high-CR play.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: claude_claude_claude | 3rd: gpt_gemini_gemini
  - *S1 has the cleanest 5e formatting, best-balanced limited-use abilities, and an elegant optional Doombot Contingency; S2 is solid but has balance issues like unlimited Retributive Strike and potential Doombot swarm problems; S3 suffers from missing Doombot stats despite referencing them, awkward Reactive Forcefield recharge design, and unnecessary Mythic complexity that bloats the encounter.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_claude_gpt
  - *S2 demonstrates the most professional design with properly implemented mythic traits, lair actions, and accurate CR 23 balance; S1 has strong thematic features but includes problematic mechanics like unlimited Power Siphon and dual concentration that strain balance; S3 is the cleanest mechanically but its CR 27 is significantly overstated for its actual offensive and defensive capabilities, which more closely match CR 24-25.*
- **1st: gemini_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gpt | 3rd: gemini_claude_claude
  - *S3 offers the best mechanical balance with appropriately limited dual concentration (3rd-level cap with disadvantage), a varied action economy via Doom Cannon, and accurate CR 24 rating; S1 is creative but the unlimited Power Siphon and uncapped dual concentration push it beyond its stated CR; S2 has excellent thematic features (Supreme Arrogance, Diplomatic Immunity) but its CR 27 rating is inflated for its actual offensive output and the Diplomatic Immunity restriction is mechanically awkward.*
- **1st: gpt_claude_gemini** | 2nd: claude_claude_gemini | 3rd: gpt_claude_gpt
  - *S3 has the cleanest 5e formatting with properly separated bonus actions, organized reactions, and distinct mythic actions, while maintaining appropriate CR 25 balance; S1 offers excellent thematic representation with the Doombot Contingency and included Doombot statblock but is slightly overtuned with DC 25 throughout and complex layered defenses; S2 is essentially a less polished version of S3 with organizational issues like bonus actions embedded in the actions section and less clear mythic action implementation.*
- **1st: gemini_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: claude_gemini_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gemini_claude
  - *S2 offers the best mechanical balance with appropriately limited abilities (3/day Power Siphon, reasonable temp HP) and accurate CR 24 design; S1 has excellent thematic depth with Doombots and lair actions but is significantly overtuned with its mythic phase adding 300 HP plus resetting Legendary Resistances; S3's unlimited Power Siphon reaction with no daily limit is a major design flaw that would excessively punish caster players without proper counterplay.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_claude** | 2nd: gemini_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gpt_gpt
  - *S1 excels with its thematically perfect Doombot Decoy mythic trait, complete Doombot statblocks, and proper lair actions—all essential Doctor Doom elements with accurate 5e formatting; S2 offers creative mechanics like Supreme Arrogance but has an inflated CR (27 is too high for its HP/defenses) and a mathematical error (Arcana +26 is impossible); S3, while cleanest to run, has multiple formatting problems including a nonexistent skill (Intelligence Technology), non-wizard cantrips without justification, and missing 8th-level slots, plus it lacks the iconic Doombots and lair that define Doom as a legendary villain.*
- **1st: claude_claude_gpt** | 2nd: claude_gpt_gemini | 3rd: claude_gemini_gpt
  - *S1 offers the best balance for CR 25 with traditional wizard spellcasting, properly calibrated defenses, and clean 5e formatting; S2 has good modern design but uses incorrect damage terminology ('electric' instead of 'lightning') and unusual reaction recharge mechanics; S3 is significantly overtuned with 750 effective HP, much higher damage output, and an automatic Supreme Intellect that makes its own Analyze legendary action redundant.*

## Round 7

- **1st: claude_gpt_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_claude_claude | 3rd: claude_gemini_claude
  - *S1 is the most mechanically sound with proper resource limits on all abilities, clean 5e formatting, excellent thematic depth, and balanced damage output; S2 is well-designed with a proper mythic trait implementation but has a more situational spell list and slightly awkward mythic action economy; S3 has critical balance issues including unlimited-use reactions (Technomagical Shield and Retributive Strike lack usage limits), the broken Arcane Supremacy mythic action that bypasses daily spell limits entirely, and inflated damage values that push it well beyond CR 25.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_claude** | 2nd: gpt_claude_gemini | 3rd: gemini_gemini_gpt
  - *S1 excels with excellent thematic flavor (Arrogant Monologue weakness, detailed Doombots), proper 5e formatting, balanced mythic mechanics, and strong CR 25 accuracy; S2 is solid with good mythic implementation but lacks Doombots and has an overtuned Unibeam; S3 breaks core 5e rules with dual concentration, uses an outdated spell-slot system unsuitable for boss design, lacks a mythic trait, and includes a non-standard skill.*
- **1st: gemini_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gpt | 3rd: gemini_gemini_claude
  - *S1 offers the cleanest 5e formatting with balanced mechanics and appropriate CR 27 scaling; S3 has thoughtful design choices like limited dual concentration with drawbacks but contains errors (missing 8th-level slot, Eldritch Blast as wizard cantrip); S2's unlimited at-will dual concentration and unrestricted Power Siphon create significant balance issues that undermine its CR 24 rating.*
- **1st: gemini_claude_claude** | 2nd: gemini_gemini_gemini | 3rd: claude_gemini_gemini
  - *S2 has the best mechanical balance with bounded abilities (3/day Power Siphon with contested checks, 3rd-level legendary spellcasting), excellent thematic additions (Supreme Arrogance, Diplomatic Immunity), and clean 5e formatting; S1 is well-designed but has an unlimited Power Siphon reaction and non-standard 'Technology' skill; S3 is overpowered with at-will 1st-3rd level spells that break action economy, has questionable CR accuracy when factoring in the mythic form's effective 750+ HP, and is significantly more complex to run despite comprehensive content.*
- **1st: claude_gemini_gpt** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_gemini | 3rd: gpt_gemini_gpt
  - *S2 excels with modern 5e formatting (simplified spellcasting), includes complete Doombot statblocks and lair actions, has excellent mythic trait execution with proper XP guidance, and offers the best playability; S1 has creative mechanics (dual concentration, Power Siphon) and strong thematic elements but contains errors (eldritch blast on wizard, fake 'Technology' skill) and lacks Doombots/lair actions; S3 has structural completeness but suffers from a broken 8th-level slot (two spells, one slot), overly situational abilities (Master of Machines), and less distinctive Doom flavor.*
- **1st: claude_claude_claude** | 2nd: gpt_claude_gpt | 3rd: gpt_gpt_gemini
  - *S1 excels with its iconic Doombot Contingency, comprehensive regional effects, included Doombot statblock, and full traditional spellcasting that properly represents Doom as a supreme sorcerer; S2 offers cleaner modern 5e design with balanced mythic mechanics but lacks regional effects; S3 has confused mythic action wording, only 2 attacks per multiattack making it weak for its CR, and feels like an incomplete version of S2.*
- **1st: gpt_gemini_gemini** | 2nd: gpt_gemini_claude | 3rd: gpt_gpt_claude
  - *S2 has the cleanest formatting with better-organized Master of Machines paragraphs and clearer Reactive Forcefield wording; S1 is nearly identical but slightly rougher; S3 introduces non-standard mythic action economy (separate pool instead of legendary action options), inconsistent design choices like 7/day Repulsor Dash alongside 1/round Reactive Forcefield, and a nerfed Master of Machines that only targets constructs.*
- **1st: claude_claude_gpt** | 2nd: gpt_gpt_gpt | 3rd: claude_claude_gemini
  - *S2 offers the most complete package with its included Doombot statblock, brilliant Doombot Contingency mechanic, clean formatting, and well-balanced CR 25 design; S1 earns second place for its innovative mythic trait system and unique technomystic abilities despite lacking Doombot stats; S3 is functionally identical to S2 but with slightly less polished formatting and some abbreviated descriptions that reduce clarity.*
- **1st: claude_gpt_gemini** | 2nd: gemini_gpt_claude | 3rd: gemini_claude_gemini
  - *S2 offers the most complete package with lair actions, Doombot minions, and mythic trait that perfectly capture Doom's iconic villain status; S3 has cleaner mechanical balance and more accurate CR but lacks lair content; S1's multiattack spell substitution is overpowered and its Power Siphon reaction is mechanically clunky compared to S3's streamlined counterspell integration.*
