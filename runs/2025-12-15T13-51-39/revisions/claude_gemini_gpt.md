***Armor of Doom.*** Doom is immune to disease and requires no air, food, drink, or sleep. The armor can’t be removed against his will. At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he regains 20 hit points if he has at least 1 hit point.

***Indomitable Will (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, or against an effect that would read his thoughts or control his mind (such as *detect thoughts* or *dominate monster*), he can choose to succeed instead.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ruler of Latveria.*** Doom has advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with creatures that recognize his authority or political power. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks made against him.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components to cast his spells.

Doom can cast *shield* and *counterspell* at will. When he casts *counterspell* this way, it is cast as a 5th-level spell.

He has the following spells prepared:
- Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, misty step*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, fire shield*
- 5th level (3 slots): *hold monster, telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, teleport*
- 8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, power word stun*
- 9th level (1 slot): *power word kill, time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Plasma Bolt, or a combination of the two. He can replace one attack with a casting of a cantrip.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to being stunned by this action for 24 hours.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) force damage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.

***Disintegrator Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom fires a beam of destructive energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 1d4 **Doombot Sentries** (see below) in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of him. The doombots act on Doom’s initiative count, immediately after Doom. They obey his commands and vanish after 1 hour or when destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** Doom gains 50 temporary hit points. While he has any of these temporary hit points, he has resistance to all damage, his speed is halved, and he can’t fly.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Deflection Matrix.*** When Doom is hit by a ranged attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he can use his reaction to deflect it. He takes no damage from *magic missile* and reduces the damage from a ranged attack by 35 (10d6). If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can redirect the attack at a creature within 60 feet, using the original attack roll against the new target.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or casts *detect magic*.

**Plasma Bolt (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Bolt attack.

**Technomantic Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom causes one technological or metal object he can see within 60 feet to violently malfunction. If a creature is wearing or holding the object, it must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage and drop the object. Constructs and creatures wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on this save.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

### Lair Actions
When fighting inside Castle Doom or another location he has prepared, Doom can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Concealed turrets target up to three creatures Doom can see. Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (8d6) force damage.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors within the lair magically seal until initiative count 20 of the next round. A sealed door can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength check or destroyed (AC 18, 50 HP, immunity to poison and psychic damage).
- **Neural Scrambler.** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 60 feet of a technological device must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 of the next round.
- **Teleportation Grid.** Doom and up to five willing creatures he can see within 120 feet each teleport to an unoccupied space of Doom’s choice within the lair.

___

> ### Doombot Deception
> *At the DM's discretion, any encounter with Doctor Doom may actually be a Doombot duplicate in disguise. When a "Doom" is reduced to 0 hit points, there is a chance (determined by the DM) that it is revealed to be a Doombot, exploding for 28 (8d6) fire damage to all creatures within 15 feet (DC 18 Dexterity save for half). The real Doom observes from a safe location, gaining intelligence on his foes.*

___

***Coordinated Targeting.*** The doombot has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one other doombot is within 5 feet of the creature and the other doombot isn’t incapacitated.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The doombot makes two attacks: one with Shock Fist and one with Arc Blaster.

***Shock Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

***Arc Blaster.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) force damage.
