Arcane Armor. Doctor Doom's armor functions as a magical spellcasting focus. While wearing it, Doom can't be disarmed of it, and he can use his reaction when a creature scores a critical hit against him to make it a normal hit instead.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

Magic Resistance. Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Spellcasting. Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks):

At will: detect magic, fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, shocking grasp
3/day each: counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, misty step, shield
2/day each: banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility, wall of force
1/day each: disintegrate, forcecage, globe of invulnerability, teleport, time stop

Master of Machines (Recharge 5–6). Doom targets one construct he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be magically dominated by Doom for 1 minute. While dominated, the construct is charmed by Doom, obeys his verbal commands (no action required by Doom), and can't target Doom with attacks or harmful abilities. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Mythic Trait: Doom Unbound. If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, he activates forbidden technomancy, regains 200 hit points, and recharges Unibeam and Master of Machines. For 1 hour, Doom has 4 legendary actions (instead of 3), and he can use the mythic action options. If Doom is defeated after his mythic trait activates, award a total of 150,000 XP.

Actions

Multiattack. Doom makes three attacks, using Gauntlet Strike or Mystic Bolt in any combination.

Gauntlet Strike. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Mystic Bolt. Ranged Spell Attack: +14 to hit, range 180 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (5d10) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from Doom.

Arcane Shackles (Recharge 6). Doom targets up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or become restrained by spectral chains for 1 minute. A restrained creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage at the start of each of its turns. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against DC 22, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Unibeam (Recharge 5–6). Doom releases a catastrophic beam in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects in the line that aren't being worn or carried take the damage as well.

Bonus Actions

Repulsor Dash. Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Reactions

Reactive Forcefield (Recharge 4–6). When Doom takes damage, he reduces the damage by 30. If the triggering damage was 30 or less, Doom can also teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

Cantrip. Doom casts fire bolt or shocking grasp.

Repulsor Step. Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

Mystic Bolt. Doom makes one Mystic Bolt attack.

Command the Arsenal (Costs 2 Actions). Doom uses Master of Machines, or he casts a spell with a 3/day frequency or higher from his Spellcasting trait.

Iron Grip (Costs 2 Actions). Doom makes one Gauntlet Strike. On a hit, the target is grappled (escape DC 22) if it is Large or smaller. Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained.

Mythic Actions (Only While Doom Unbound)

Doom can take 1 mythic action, choosing from the options below, at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains his spent mythic action at the start of his turn.

Overload the Field. Doom emits a pulse of destabilizing energy. Each creature of Doom's choice within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d10) force damage and be unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn.

Sovereign's Edict. Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of Doom until the end of its next turn. While frightened in this way, the creature's speed is 0.

Lair Actions (Castle Doom)

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one of the following lair actions; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Automated Batteries. Arcane turrets fire at up to three creatures Doom can see within 120 feet. Each target must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- Seal the Throne Room. Doom conjures shifting runes and armored bulkheads. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the area within 60 feet of Doom is difficult terrain for Doom's enemies, and doors and openings in the lair within that area are sealed as if by arcane lock.
- Null-Magic Surge. Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or have any one spell of 5th level or lower currently affecting it end immediately (Doom's choice). If the target is concentrating, it has disadvantage on the next concentration saving throw it makes before initiative count 20 on the next round.
