***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom's armor can't be removed against his will and requires no action to don or doff. While wearing it, Doom has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, can't be disarmed, and gains a +2 bonus to melee weapon damage rolls (included in Doomfist Strike).

***Diplomatic Immunity.*** Doom has advantage on Charisma checks made to negotiate, intimidate, or parley. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against him.

***Doombot Decoy (1/Day).*** When Doom drops to 0 hit points, he can choose to have the "body" revealed as a Doombot while the real Doom appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet that he can see. Doom returns with hit points equal to half his hit point maximum.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can't be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks):

At will: *detect magic*, *fire bolt*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *ray of frost*, *shocking grasp*
3/day each: *absorb elements*, *counterspell*, *dimension door*, *dispel magic*, *greater invisibility*, *lightning bolt*, *mirror image*, *misty step*, *shield*
2/day each: *disintegrate*, *dominate person*, *forcecage*, *globe of invulnerability*, *telekinesis*, *wall of force*
1/day each: *dominate monster*, *plane shift*, *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Doomfist Strike or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or it can't take reactions and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

---
## Bonus Actions

***Personal Force Field (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Doom activates a force field that grants him 30 temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points remain, he has resistance to all damage.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. He can use this ability even while grappled or restrained.

---
## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (1/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no spell slot or material components.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

**Automated Defenses.** Hidden turrets fire at intruders. Each creature of Doom's choice that he can see within the lair must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Security Lockdown.** Doom causes a door, portcullis, or force field to slam shut or open. One passage within the lair becomes blocked or unblocked until Doom uses this lair action again.

**Holographic Duplicates.** Doom creates 1d4 illusory duplicates of himself that last until initiative count 20 on the next round. Attack rolls against Doom have disadvantage while at least one duplicate exists. A creature can use its action to make a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check, destroying one duplicate on a success.
