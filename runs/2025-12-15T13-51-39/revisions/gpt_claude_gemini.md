***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will and requires no action to don or doff. While he wears it, Doom has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, he can’t be disarmed, and he gains a +2 bonus to melee weapon damage rolls (included in the attack).

***Doombot Decoy (1/Day).*** When Doom drops to 0 hit points, he is revealed to be a mechanical duplicate. The body explodes, destroying itself and dealing 21 (6d6) fire damage to creatures within 10 feet (DC 21 Dexterity save for half). The real Doom appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet that he can see with half his hit point maximum. Doom then rolls initiative and re-enters combat at the start of the next round (or continues acting if he has not taken a turn this round).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile, shield*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *hold person, mirror image, misty step*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *dimension door, greater invisibility, stoneskin*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force*
- **6th level (2 slots):** *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*
- **8th level (1 slot):** *dominate monster*
- **9th level (1 slot):** *prismatic wall*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Doomfist Strike or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Personal Force Field (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Doom activates a shimmering energy barrier. He gains 30 temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points remain, he has resistance to all damage.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. He can use this ability even while grappled or restrained.

## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no material components.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Cantrip.*** Doom casts a cantrip.

***Commanding Step.*** Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Doomfist.*** Doom makes one Doomfist Strike attack.

***Arcane Gauntlet (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet Blast attack.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his list of prepared spells.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Automated Defenses.** Hidden turrets emerge from the walls or ceiling. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 120 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save.
*   **Security Lockdown.** Doom alters the facility's geometry. He targets a door, portcullis, or passage he can see. It either slams shut and locks (requiring a DC 25 Athletics check to force open) or opens. Alternatively, a wall of force (as per the spell, but a flat 10x10 panel) appears to block a corridor until the next initiative count 20.
*   **Holographic Duplicates.** Doom projects 1d4 illusory duplicates of himself in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. These function as the *mirror image* spell but can be targeted independently (AC 15, 1 HP). While at least one duplicate exists, attack rolls against Doom have disadvantage. The duplicates fade at the next initiative count 20.
