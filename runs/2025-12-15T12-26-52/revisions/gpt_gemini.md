### Traits

**Arcane Power Armor.** Doom can’t be disarmed of his armor. While wearing it, he has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration, and he ignores the somatic component of spells he casts.

**Electrified Feedback.** When a creature hits Doom with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him, the attacker takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

**Genius Tactician.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised while conscious.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Sovereign’s Presence.** Creatures of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him that can see or hear him have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes four attacks in any combination using his **Armored Gauntlet** and **Repulsor Beam** (no more than three Repulsor Beam attacks). Alternatively, Doom casts a spell and makes two attacks: one with his **Armored Gauntlet** and one with his **Repulsor Beam**.

**Armored Gauntlet.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.  
**Gravitic Impact (1/Turn).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet (Doom’s choice).

**Repulsor Beam.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d10) force damage.

**Technomystic Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom releases a surge of hexed energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. **Each creature in the cone is pushed 20 feet away from Doom** (regardless of the save). A creature that fails the save also can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Mystic Shackles (Recharge 6).** Doom targets up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 27 (6d8) force damage and become **restrained** for 1 minute. A restrained target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

---

### Reactions

**Arcane Countermeasures (Recharge 4–6).** When Doom is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, he can use his reaction to gain one of the following benefits:
- **Deflecting Field:** Doom gains a +5 bonus to AC against the triggering attack (potentially causing it to miss).
- **Stabilizing Runes:** Doom gains a +4 bonus to the triggering saving throw (potentially causing it to succeed).

---

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Gauntlet Strike.** Doom makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.

**Jet Boost.** Doom moves up to half his flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Repulsor Shot (1/Turn).** Doom makes one **Repulsor Beam** attack.

**Imperious Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet that can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to Doom’s Imperious Command for 24 hours.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

---

## Optional: Lair Actions (Castle Doom)
When fighting inside his seat of power, Doom can invoke lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action below; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Seal the Chamber.** Arcane-metal doors slam shut. Up to three openings Doom can see within 120 feet become sealed by reinforced barriers (AC 19; 40 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic).  
2. **Holographic Doombots.** Doom projects three illusory decoys around himself until initiative count 20 on the next round. While at least one decoy remains, attack rolls against Doom are made with disadvantage. Whenever an attack would hit Doom, one decoy is destroyed (potentially turning the hit into a miss).  
3. **Null-Mystic Surge.** Each enemy spellcaster of Doom’s choice within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on concentration checks and can’t cast spells using reactions (such as *counterspell*) until initiative count 20 on the next round.
