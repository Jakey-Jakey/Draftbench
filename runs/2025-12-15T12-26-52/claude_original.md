# DOCTOR DOOM
## Sovereign of Latveria, Master of Science and Sorcery

*Victor Von Doom is the iron-fisted ruler of the nation of Latveria, a genius polymath whose intellect rivals the greatest minds of any age, and a master sorcerer who has bargained with demons and death itself. Encased in an suit of armor that melds arcane might with technological supremacy, Doom seeks nothing less than absolute dominion—convinced, with unwavering certainty, that only under his rule can the world achieve its true potential. His arrogance is matched only by his competence, making him one of the most dangerous beings to ever challenge those who would call themselves heroes.*

> ### TRAITS
>
> ***Doom's Armor.*** Doom's armor is a masterwork of techno-sorcery. While wearing it, Doom has resistance to damage from spells, cannot be targeted by divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors, and is immune to disease. If Doom is subjected to an effect that would move him against his will, he can use his reaction to reduce the distance moved by up to 20 feet.
>
> ***Indomitable Will.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects. Additionally, if Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect, the creature that created it takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage (no save).
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. When he does so, his armor crackles with dispersed energy, and each creature of his choice within 10 feet of him takes 10 force damage.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***The Pride of Doom.*** Doom cannot willingly retreat from combat unless he has been reduced to fewer than 100 hit points. His conviction in his own superiority is absolute.
>
> ***Doombot Protocol (1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he can choose for this to have actually been a Doombot—a perfect mechanical replica. The Doombot crumbles into sparking wreckage, and the "encounter" ends, though the real Doom (wherever he is) is fully aware of everything that transpired. *The DM should use this ability to reflect Doom's legendary paranoia and preparation, not to invalidate player victory. Consider having the Doombot carry important plot items or information as a reward.*
>
> ---
>
> ### SPELLCASTING
>
> Doom is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
>
> **At will:** *detect magic, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shield*
>
> **3/day each:** *counterspell, dimension door, dispel magic, fireball* (cast at 6th level), *mirror image*
>
> **2/day each:** *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability, hold monster, wall of force*
>
> **1/day each:** *forcecage, power word stun, time stop*
>
> ---
>
> ### ACTIONS
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Energy Blast, or a combination thereof. He can replace one attack with casting a spell of 5th level or lower.
>
> ***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Energy Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d10 + 5) force damage. This attack ignores cover.
>
> ***Molecular Expulsion (Recharge 5-6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating blast of energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more are also pushed 20 feet away from Doom and knocked prone. Nonmagical objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take maximum damage.
>
> ---
>
> ### BONUS ACTIONS
>
> ***Tactical Superiority.*** Doom flies up to half his flying speed or teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
>
> ***Energy Shield (Recharge 4-6).*** Doom activates a shimmering barrier of force around himself. Until the start of his next turn, he has a +5 bonus to AC, automatically succeeds on saving throws against *magic missile*, and has resistance to all damage.
>
> ---
>
> ### REACTIONS
>
> ***Reactive Force Field.*** When Doom takes damage from an attack or spell, he can reduce that damage by 35.
>
> ***Arcane Supremacy.*** When Doom sees a creature within 120 feet of him casting a spell, he can cast *counterspell* at 5th level without expending a spell slot. When he uses *counterspell* in this way, he automatically counters spells of 5th level or lower; for higher-level spells, he must make an ability check as normal.
>
> ---
>
> ### LEGENDARY ACTIONS
>
> Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check.
>
> **Energy Blast (Costs 1 Action).** Doom makes one Energy Blast attack.
>
> **Reposition (Costs 1 Action).** Doom uses his Tactical Superiority bonus action.
>
> **Doom Speaks (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom issues a imperious command or scathing rebuke. Each hostile creature within 30 feet that can hear Doom must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of Doom until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails this save by 5 or more is also paralyzed for the same duration.
>
> **Sorcerous Wrath (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his spell list.
>

## LAIR: CASTLE DOOM

Castle Doom is a towering fortress of dark stone and gleaming metal, rising from the heart of Latveria. Within its walls, arcane wards intertwine with technological surveillance systems, and armies of Servo-Guards patrol corridors filled with priceless art and forbidden knowledge.

### LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Doom can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Servo-Guard Deployment.** Four Servo-Guards emerge from hidden compartments. Use the **veteran** statistics with the following changes: they are Constructs, have immunity to poison and psychic damage, and cannot be charmed or frightened. They appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of Doom, act on initiative count 15, and obey Doom's telepathic commands. They remain until destroyed or dismissed.

- **Defense Matrix.** Doom activates concealed weapon systems. Up to four creatures Doom can see within the lair must each make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

- **Temporal Lock.** Doom activates wards that distort space and time. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, no creature within the lair can teleport, use extradimensional travel (including *dimension door*, *misty step*, *teleport*, *plane shift*, or similar effects), or benefit from spells or effects that grant additional actions.

- **Doombot Decoys.** Two illusory duplicates of Doom appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act on initiative count 10 and can move and take the Dodge action. A creature can use its action to make a DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check, identifying a duplicate on a success. Each duplicate has AC 24 and 1 hit point, and is immune to all conditions. If a duplicate is forced to make a saving throw, it automatically fails.

---

### REGIONAL EFFECTS

The region within 6 miles of Castle Doom is warped by Doom's power:

- **Technological Interference.** Magical and technological devices not belonging to Doom occasionally malfunction. Any creature other than Doom that uses a magic item in this region must roll a d20; on a 1, the item doesn't function until the start of their next turn.

- **The Eyes of Doom.** Doom is instantly aware when any creature within 1 mile speaks his name aloud, and learns the creature's exact location when it does so.

- **Fanatical Loyalty.** The citizens of the region cannot be magically compelled to act against Doom's interests. Spells like *charm person*, *dominate person*, *suggestion*, and similar effects automatically fail if they would cause a Latverian citizen to betray Doom.

- **Oppressive Atmosphere.** The sky above Latveria is perpetually overcast, and a faint sense of being watched pervades the land. Creatures other than Doom and his allies have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made within this region.

If Doom dies, these effects fade over 1d10 days.

---

## TACTICS

**Before Combat:** Doom never enters battle unprepared. He has studied his enemies extensively and has contingencies for their abilities. He typically opens important encounters with *time stop* to position himself advantageously and raise defenses.

**During Combat:** Doom stays at range, using *wall of force* and *forcecage* to control the battlefield while blasting enemies with Energy Blasts and spells. He uses *counterspell* liberally against enemy spellcasters, whom he considers his primary threats. If forced into melee, his Gauntlet Strike's stunning effect can create breathing room. He reserves Molecular Expulsion for clustered enemies.

**Morale:** Doom refuses to believe he can lose—until the evidence becomes undeniable. Once reduced below 100 hit points, he considers tactical withdrawal via *dimension door* or activates the Doombot Protocol. Doom always returns to take vengeance on those who humbled him.

**Party Composition Considerations:** 
- Against **high-damage martial characters**: Doom uses *wall of force* to separate them from allies, then focuses fire.
- Against **spellcasters**: Doom's *counterspell* and Magic Resistance make him extremely difficult to affect. He targets them first.
- Against **support-focused parties**: *Forcecage* and *hold monster* neutralize key members.

## PLOT HOOKS

| d6 | Hook |
|:--:|:-----|
| 1 | Doom has acquired an artifact of immense power and plans to use it to "improve" the world—whether it wants to be improved or not. |
| 2 | A delegation from Latveria requests the party's aid—Doom has been replaced by an imposter (or so they claim). |
| 3 | Doom offers the party a deal: aid him against a mutual enemy, and he will owe them a single favor. His word, as always, is iron. |
| 4 | The party discovers Doom is one of several villains competing in a deadly game orchestrated by a cosmic entity. |
| 5 | Time-displaced heroes appear, warning that Doom will one day save reality itself—but the party's current actions may prevent that future. |
| 6 | Doom seeks to rescue his mother's soul from a demon lord's domain. He "requests" the party's assistance. Refusal is... inadvisable. |
