***Doom Armor.*** Doom’s armor grants the following benefits: his AC includes his Intelligence modifier; he can breathe in any environment (including vacuum); he is immune to disease; and he has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will.

***Indomitable Will.*** If Doom succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or having his mind read or controlled, the creature that forced the save takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components. Intelligence is his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks; +17 on ability checks to resolve *counterspell* and *dispel magic*).

- **At will:** *detect magic, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation*  
- **3/day each:** *counterspell, dispel magic, dimension door, greater invisibility, wall of force*  
- **1/day each:** *dominate monster, forcecage, globe of invulnerability, plane shift, power word kill, power word stun, teleport, time stop*

***Supreme Intellect.*** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he analyzes one creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the start of Doom’s next turn, Doom has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Doom’s spells and abilities.

***Doombot Protocol (Mythic Trait; 1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn’t die or fall unconscious. Instead, his body detonates and is revealed to have been a Doombot duplicate. Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The real Doom then appears in an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet with 300 hit points, and all conditions affecting him end. Doom also regains all expended uses of Legendary Resistance, and **Doom Blast** immediately recharges.  
If this trait activates, award XP as though Doom were defeated twice (150,000 XP).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks, in any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (4d10 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of arcane devastation. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 81 (18d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is disintegrated, leaving behind only worn or carried magic items.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons **two Doombots** in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. They act on Doom’s initiative (immediately after Doom) and obey his commands. They last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

### Reactions

***Technomagical Shield.*** When Doom is hit by an attack, targeted by the *magic missile* spell, or forced to make a saving throw, Doom conjures a barrier of force. Doom gains one of the following benefits (Doom’s choice):
- **Deflect:** Doom gains a +5 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn, including against the triggering attack.  
- **Recalibrate:** Doom gains a +5 bonus to the triggering saving throw.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Analyze.** Doom uses Supreme Intellect, choosing a new creature to analyze.  
**Tactical Teleport.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.  
**Plasma Bolt.** Doom makes one Plasma Bolt attack.  
**Raise Force Screen (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom gains resistance to all damage until the start of his next turn.  
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.  
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell from Spellcasting (up to 5th level).  
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 20 feet of him must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save and being stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.

## LAIR ACTIONS (CASTLE DOOM)

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombots.** Two **Doombots** emerge from hidden alcoves in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of Doom.  
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see within 120 feet must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Lockdown Protocol.** Doors, portcullises, and passages within 120 feet seal shut until initiative count 20 of the next round. Each sealed barrier has AC 18, 100 hit points, a damage threshold of 20, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Doom can open any sealed barrier at will (no action required).  
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point Doom can see within 120 feet. Creatures in that area must make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.
