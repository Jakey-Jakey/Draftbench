Here is a comprehensive review of your **Victor Von Doom** statblock.

Overall, this is a **strong, high-quality boss monster** that accurately captures the feel of a Tier 4 "Avengers-level threat." You have successfully blended high-tier Wizardry with technological superiorirty. The CR 24 assessment is mathematically close, though he swings wildly in power depending on how you play him.

Below is a breakdown of mechanical balance, formatting conventions, and gameplay recommendations.

### 1. Thematic & Design Strengths
*   **Scientific Sorcery:** This is the highlight of the block. Allowing dual concentration fits Doom perfectly (his mind is disciplined enough to multitask magic). It solves the "Caster Boss" problem where they cast *Fly*, get hit, lose it, and fall.
*   **The "Feel":** The high AC (techno-armor), the arrogance (*Kneel Before Doom*), and the diplomatic immunity (*Power Siphon*) feel very lore-accurate.
*   **Action Economy:** Adopting the modern *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse (MPMM)* style of allowing spellcasting within Multiattack is excellent design for high-CR casters.

### 2. Mechanical Balance & CR Issues

**Calculated CR:**
Defensively, he is roughly CR 22 (Effective HP ~415 with shields/regen, AC 22-27). Offensively, he outputs ~150-180 damage per round. **CR 24 is an accurate label**, but only if played intelligently.

**Action Economy Loophole (Important):**
In **Multiattack**, you wrote: *"He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting."*
*   **The Risk:** As written, Doom can cast *Chain Lightning* (Action), use *Time Stop* (Action), or *Teleport* twice per turn if he has the slots.
*   **The Fix:** Modern 5e design restricts this swap. It typically says: "He can substitute one attack for a use of **Spellcasting (Cantrip Only)**" or limits the level of the spell (e.g., "a spell of 3rd level or lower").
*   **Recommendation:** Change the text to allow him to cast a Cantrip or a specific list of lower-level spells to prevent him from burning two 7th+ level slots in a single round (one via Action, one via Reaction/Legendary).

**The Double Concentration Problem:**
While thematic, `Scientific Sorcery` is dangerous for table fun.
*   **Scenario:** Doom casts *Wall of Force* (trapping the Fighter) and *Hold Person* (paralyzing the Cleric) simultaneously.
*   **Note:** *Forcecage* does **not** require concentration in 5e. This means Doom can have a *Forcecage* active AND maintain two concentration spells. This effectively removes 2-3 players from combat entirely.
*   **Recommendation:** Keep the trait, but perhaps add a limitation: *"While concentrating on two spells, Doom cannot take Legendary Actions,"* or simply be aware as a DM that this can result in a Total Party Kill (TPK) very quickly.

### 3. Formatting & Syntax Corrections

*   **Skill: Technology:** "Technology" is not a standard 5e skill.
    *   *Fix:* Note it as **(Intelligence) Technology +20** or fold it into **Arcana** or **Performance** (for gadgets). If this is a sci-fi campaign specific skill, keep it.
*   **Cantrip Typo:** *"meticulously word of radiance"* looks like a copy-paste error. This should likely just be *Word of Radiance* or perhaps *Mending*.
*   **Cantrip Redundancy:** He has *Eldritch Blast* prepared, but also has a **Gauntlet Blast** action.
    *   *Gauntlet Blast* is significantly better (+17 to hit vs likely smaller bonus for EB, and flat high damage).
    *   *Recommendation:* Remove *Eldritch Blast* from the spell list to declutter. His Gauntlets *are* his Eldritch Blast.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Condition Issue):**
    *   "Grappled by their own weight."
    *   *Mechanical Issue:* Grappled reduces speed to 0. It does not impose Disadvantage or grant Advantage to attackers.
    *   *Fix:* Change the condition to **Restrained**. This fits the flavor of being crushed by gravity better and is mechanically more threatening for a 3-action cost. Additionally, specify that the condition ends if Doom is incapacitated or chooses to end it (no action).

### 4. Detailed Spellcasting Review

*   **Save DC 25:** This is appropriate for a CR 24 creature with 30 INT.
*   **Spell Attacks (+17):** This implies a +7 Proficiency and +10 INT. This mimics player math perfectly.
*   **Reaction - Power Siphon:**
    *   The mechanic *"Intelligence check contested by the caster's spellcasting ability check"* is slow at the table.
    *   **Optimization:** Standardize it to *Counterspell* rules or similar: *"Doom makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails..."* This is faster than asking the Bard to roll a check every time.
    *   **Buff:** The slot regeneration is a brilliant mechanic. Keep that.

### 5. Revised Statblock Suggestions

Here are the specific text swaps to polish the block:

**In Actions:**
> ***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two Gauntlet Blast attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting (cantrip only).

**In Legendary Actions:**
> ***Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational dominance. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw (changed from Wisdom, gravity is usually Str). On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) force damage, is knocked prone, and is **Restrained** (escape DC 25). To escape, the creature must use an action to make a Strength check.

**Spell List Tweak:**
> Swap *Scrying* (useless in combat) for *Synaptic Static* (INT save, psychic damage, debuffs attacks—very fitting for Doom disrupting his enemies' coordination).

### Summary
This is a boss that requires a high-level party (Level 17+) to beat. He is extremely durable due to the recurring Temp HP and high AC/Saves. His damage is high, but his true threat is **control**. Between *Wall of Force*, *Forcecage*, *Banishment*, and *Time Stop*, he can dismantle the action economy of the players.

**Verdict:** 9/10. With the minor formatting fixes and the change to "Restrained" on the gravity attack, this is ready to run.
