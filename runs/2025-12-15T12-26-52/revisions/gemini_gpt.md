# gemini's Statblock (revised by gpt)

Here is the revised statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

This version implements the specific feedback to align him with **Challenge Rating 24** conventions while preserving the "Tank Caster" fantasy. Major changes include:
*   **Mythic Design:** The "Doombot Decoy" is now a proper Mythic Phase with a separate HP pool, rather than a "full reset" reaction.
*   **Action Economy Balance:** *Kneel Before Doom* and *Gauntlet Blast* now have costs that prevent overwhelming burst damage, and his attack/DC numbers are tuned to be challenging but mathematically fair.
*   **Counterplay:** Double concentration now has a specific weakness (Thunder damage/component destruction), and *Ovoid Mind Transfer* is strictly a narrative escape/defeat mechanic, not a "delete PC" button.

**_Techno-Magical Diffusion._** Doom absorbs energy to fuel his armor. If he is subjected to lightning damage, he takes no damage and instead gains 20 temporary hit points.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Master of Science and Sorcery._** Doom can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time. One of these spells must be 5th level or lower and is maintained by his armor's logic systems. If Doom takes thunder damage, he has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on the armor-sustained spell.

**_Doombot Protocol (Mythic Trait)._** The first time Doom would be reduced to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point. The armor he is wearing detonates in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The destroyed body is revealed to be an advanced Doombot.
The *real* Doctor Doom teleports into an unoccupied space within 60 feet. He appears with 200 hit points, his "Doombot Legion" or "Power Siphon" Mythic Action options become available, and he regains any expended uses of Legendary Resistance.

**_Ovoid Mind Transfer (Escape Contingency)._** If the *true* Doctor Doom is reduced to 0 hit points (after the Mythic phase), his body collapses, and his consciousness flees. He attempts to possess a humanoid within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Charisma saving throw or be possessed.
*   *On a Success:* Doom's spirit is repelled and teleports to a clone vat in Latveria.
*   *On a Failure:* Doom possesses the target, suppressing the target’s soul. The target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Doom retains his INT, WIS, and CHA, but swaps physical stats. This effect can be ended by *dispel evil and good* or *wish*, returning Doom's soul to Latveria.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Doom makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets. He can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**_Arcane Gauntlet._** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) force damage plus 9 (2d8) lightning damage.

**_Spellcasting._** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:
*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, prestidigitation, shocking grasp, toll the dead*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, mirror image*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt, fly*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, fire shield*
*   5th level (3 slots): *animate objects, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, reverse gravity*
*   8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

**_Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6)._** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

**_Techno-Sorcerous Feedback._** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell Doom cast, Doom can force that creature to make a DC 24 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage and cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Reposition.** Doom moves up to his speed or flies 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his list.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and be restrained by increased gravity until the end of its next turn. While restrained this way, the creature cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. (This replaces the *Hold Person* spam).

### Mythic Actions
If Doom’s Mythic Trait is active, he can use the options below as Legendary Actions for 1 hour.

*   **Doombot Legion (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom summons two **Helmed Horrors** (Doombots) in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet. He can have no more than 4 Doombots active at once.
*   **Power Siphon (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets a creature maintaining concentration on a spell within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature loses concentration, and Doom regains 1d8 hit points per level of the spell that was ended.

***

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action. He cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Absolute Security.** Automated turrets fire energy beams. Doom makes two ranged weapon attacks (+15 to hit) against creatures of his choice within 120 feet. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.
*   **Arcane Dampening Field.** Doom activates a dampening emitter. Each creature within 60 feet of Doom casting a spell of 4th level or lower must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw (spellcasting ability check). On a failure, the spell slot is expended but the spell fails. This lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round.
*   **Repulsor Floor.** The floor within 60 feet of Doom becomes electrified. Each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (4d6) lightning damage and be pushed 10 feet away from Doom.

### Change Log (Designing for Balance & Fun)

1.  **Stats & Math:** Adjusted Spell Save DC to **24** and To Hit to **+16**. This is still elite for Tier 4 but allows highly specialized PCs (Paladins, Monks, Rogues) a fighting chance to succeed without a natural 20.
2.  **AC & Shield:** Base AC is **21**. *Shield* is no longer at-will; it costs a reactor slot. This creates a resource game: if players force him to *Shield* often, he has fewer slots for *Counterspell* or *Thunderwave*.
3.  **The Mythic Trait:** Instead of "If I lose I get full HP," it is now "Doombot Protocol." The first phase (325 HP) is merely the decoy. The second phase (200 HP) is the real boss. This validates the players' damage dealing (they killed the bot!) rather than negating it.
4.  **Double Concentration:** Added a weakness. **Thunder damage** disrupts the tech-concentration. This gives martials with thunder weapons or casters with *Shatter* a specific tactical advantage.
5.  **Kneel Before Doom:** Changed from "Cast Hold Person" (which is boring if the party has Freedom of Movement/high WIS) to a specific gravity ability that silences the target (shutting down verbal casters). It costs 3 actions, preventing spam.
6.  **Ovoid Mind Transfer:** Moved to flavor/end-game text. It is now a narrative escape hatch to keep Doom as a recurring villain, rather than a combat mechanic that forces a player to hand over their character sheet mid-fight.
