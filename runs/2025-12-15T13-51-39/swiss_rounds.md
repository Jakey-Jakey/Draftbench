# Swiss Tournament Log

## Round 1

- **gemini_gemini_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat claude_claude_gpt: Uses the correct +7 proficiency bonus for CR 25 (claude_claude_gpt incorrectly uses +8), has more thematically rich abilities like the enhanced counterspell and dominate immunity, and offers more interesting tactical choices with the toggle-based Force Field rather than simple temp HP.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gpt_claude_claude: Superior thematic representation with INT 28 befitting Doom's genius, the excellent Technomantic Assault legendary action capturing his science-sorcery fusion, more appropriate CR 25 power level, and the optional Doombot Deception sidebar being better design than a mandatory 'gotcha' mechanic that essentially grants 50% more HP.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_gemini: The innate spellcasting format is cleaner and easier to run at the table, the Doombot Decoy is more elegant without confusing initiative re-roll mechanics, the fly speed properly includes '(hover)', and the 1/day Counterspell Protocol reaction is more balanced since counterspell is already available 3/day through normal spellcasting.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gemini_claude_claude: The three-attack multiattack better supports CR 20 damage output, the Personal Force Field is more mechanically balanced (halving damage rather than complete magical negation), the 1-cost Electrified Jab legendary action improves action economy, and it includes better edge-case handling for Vector Trap's failure conditions.
- **gemini_claude_gemini** beat claude_gpt_claude: While claude_gpt_claude has nice additions like a Doombot statblock and flavorful sidebars, it breaks core 5e conventions with at-will shield (making mundane attacks nearly useless), dual concentration (no precedent in 5e), and inflated numbers that make CR accuracy questionable; gemini_claude_gemini follows proper 5e design, has more accurate CR 21 math, uses standard spell slot casting, and offers interesting thematic abilities like Vector Trap and Power Siphon without breaking the system.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gpt_gemini: Features proper 5e formatting (no nonexistent 'Technology' skill), includes complete Doombot statblock instead of referencing another monster, has better mechanical balance with meaningful trade-offs (Force Field speed penalty, acid vulnerability on regeneration), and includes the excellent Doombot Deception sidebar for DM guidance.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: The inclusion of Magic Resistance is essential for a CR 22 creature and thematically vital for Doctor Doom; additionally, Spell Turning is properly formatted in the Reactions section rather than awkwardly placed as a trait with a '(Reaction)' tag.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_gpt_claude: While both are solid, gpt_gpt_gemini offers better playability with streamlined spellcasting (modern 5e design), superior action economy (bonus action teleport), and excellent thematic abilities like Spell Turning and the Mystic-Scientific Beam that perfectly capture Doom's magic/tech fusion, while maintaining appropriate CR 22 balance.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: Better balanced legendary action costs (Gauntlet Blast at 2 actions vs free), more appropriate Mind Blank as a trackable 1/day resource rather than permanent immunity stacking, and Vector Trap is powerful but fair (restrained until end of turn) compared to the overpowered pocket dimension banishment that removes targets for up to a minute.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat claude_gemini_claude: The Force Field being limited to 3/Day with meaningful trade-offs (halved speed, can't fly) and counterspell at-will being capped at 5th level instead of 9th-level creates better mechanical balance for a CR 25 creature, making encounters more playable and tactically interesting rather than oppressively one-sided.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_claude: Superior thematic representation with Latveria ruler trait, indomitable will, and essential lair actions for Castle Doom; better 5e formatting with lair actions included and Doombot as flexible DM sidebar rather than confusing built-in resurrection mechanic; more accurate CR 25 rating for the defensive suite, while the opponent's dual concentration and missing lair actions are significant 5e violations.
- **gpt_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: Both statblocks are nearly identical, but gpt_gemini_gpt includes additional thematically appropriate traits (Arcane Stabilizers and Dual Concentration Matrix) that better represent Doom's legendary magical prowess, while gpt_gemini_gemini has a notable typo in its Spell Turning trait ('looking that targets only Doom').
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_claude: The GPT version has cleaner mechanics (Power Siphon as Recharge 5-6 instead of slot management), self-contained ability descriptions (Vector Trap fully explained without referencing banishment), the thematic Adaptive Force Field, and the clever distinction that gauntlet attacks are weapon attacks rather than spells—better representing Doom's tech-magic duality and improving playability.

## Round 2

- **gemini_gemini_claude** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat claude_claude_gemini: The first statblock has cleaner mechanics (Gauntlet Strike stun timing, explicit expertise notation), more thematically appropriate Supreme Sorcerer abilities (enhanced counterspell and dual concentration with balanced restrictions), and better-written targeting language for Technomantic Assault, while the second's confusing 'shield included in AC calculations' note is incorrect for how the spell functions.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gemini_claude_gpt: Uses modern innate spellcasting format (easier to run), has better CR-appropriate HP (322 vs 247), features the thematically excellent 'Mystic-Scientific Beam' capturing Doom's tech-magic fusion, and avoids problematic mechanics like Vector Trap's combat-removing teleport and mandatory Frightful Presence every multiattack.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_claude_gemini: The CR 25 statblock provides superior value with a complete Doombot stat block, the brilliant 'Doombot Deception' sidebar capturing a classic comic trope, better thematic features like 'Ruler of Latveria,' and a power level more befitting Marvel's premier supervillain, while maintaining solid 5e formatting and mechanical balance.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: While gpt_gpt_gemini includes the thematically important flight speed, gpt_gpt_claude wins with modern 5e innate spellcasting format, a more comprehensive and thematic spell list (dominate, disintegrate, teleport), and crucially a balanced 3/day Spell Turning—whereas gpt_gpt_gemini's unlimited Spell Turning is mechanically problematic.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gpt: While claude_gemini_gpt offers excellent thematic content (lair actions, Doombot stats), its at-will 5th-level counterspell combined with at-will shield, redundant save features (both Legendary Resistance AND Indomitable Will), and 20 HP/turn regeneration creates severe balance issues that would frustrate players; gemini_gpt_gpt is more mechanically sound, follows standard 5e design conventions, and would be significantly more playable at the table.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: The first statblock better captures Doctor Doom thematically (Ruler of Latveria trait, Doombots, lair actions for Castle Doom) and follows 5e design conventions more closely, while the second introduces problematic mechanics like Dual Concentration Matrix and Paradox Reflexes that fundamentally break 5e's design paradigms without proper CR compensation.
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: It has cleaner mechanics (recharge-based Power Siphon without slot tracking, Adaptive Force Field for thematic survivability), properly labels attacks as 'Weapon Attacks' consistent with its Arcane Technology trait, and avoids the typo ('the Doom') present in the other statblock.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_claude: This statblock better captures Doctor Doom's dual nature as supreme sorcerer AND tech genius through features like dual concentration, Technomantic Assault, actual Doombot summoning, and comprehensive spellcasting with traditional slots—plus the Doombot Deception sidebar adds excellent GM-facing narrative tools, making it a more thematically complete and appropriately threatening CR 25 legendary villain despite being more complex to run.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_claude: It has cleaner 5e formatting, correct skill calculations (gemini_claude_claude has Arcana +22 which appears to be a math error), better-balanced abilities without potentially problematic effects like Vector Trap's forced teleportation to a prepared forcecage, and the Doombot Decoy mechanic is a clever thematic touch that maintains gameplay flow rather than removing players from combat.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_gpt_gemini: Uses modern 5e spellcasting format for easier play, includes a complete Doombot statblock rather than requiring Helmed Horror reference, has balanced regeneration with clear counters, properly formats 5e skills (gemini's 'Technology' skill doesn't exist), and the dual concentration plus Doombot Deception sidebar better capture Doom's 'Supreme Sorcerer' theme.
- **gpt_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_claude: While gemini_gpt_claude includes thematic elements like Doombots and flight, gpt_gpt_gpt follows modern 5e design with a streamlined spellcasting format that's far more playable, features the creative Spell Turning and Mystic-Scientific Beam abilities, has better HP sustainability (322 vs 247) appropriate for a CR 22 boss, and maintains cleaner action economy without the complexity of tracking full wizard spell slots.
- **gemini_gpt_gemini** beat claude_gemini_claude: While claude_gemini_claude offers superior thematic depth with lair actions and Doombot stats, its mechanical balance is compromised by unlimited free counterspell at 9th-level power, costless bonus action teleportation, and a resource-free Force Field granting 50 temp HP plus resistance—features that stack to exceed CR 25 and undermine playable challenge design.
- **gpt_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: The Claude statblock includes the iconic Doombot Decoy trait (highly thematic for Doctor Doom), dual concentration (fitting his mastery of magic and science), has consistent save DCs throughout, and avoids the typo present in the Gemini version's Spell Turning trait ('looking that targets').

## Round 3

- **gpt_gemini_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gpt_claude_gpt: While more complex, it better captures Doctor Doom's identity as supreme sorcerer AND technological genius with features like dual concentration, Indomitable Will, Ruler of Latveria, and the excellent Doombot Deception sidebar—the gpt version feels more generic and undersells Doom's gravitas as an Avengers-level threat.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_claude: The claude_gpt_gpt statblock is significantly more thematically complete, including essential Doctor Doom elements like Doombots (with their own statblock), lair actions for Castle Doom, and the brilliant Doombot Deception sidebar, while maintaining proper 5e formatting and more appropriate CR 25 power level for one of Marvel's premier villains.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gemini: While claude_gemini_gemini has creative elements like lair actions, it contains significant issues: 'Technology' isn't a real 5e skill, at-will counterspell with auto-success on 5th level or lower is game-breakingly overpowered, and the repeatable Force Field bonus action (50 temp HP + resistance to all damage) makes it nearly unkillable—these mechanics severely undermine CR accuracy and playability compared to the more balanced and properly formatted gemini_gpt_gpt.
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat claude_claude_gpt: Better mechanical balance with accurate CR 21 assessment, cleaner adherence to 5e conventions (no dual concentration or shield at will), and more elegant design choices like Power Siphon and using Helmed Horror stats for Doombots, making it more playable while still capturing Doom's essence.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gpt_claude_gemini: It better captures Doctor Doom's legendary status with more thematic features (Ruler of Latveria, Indomitable Will, Technomantic Assault), a higher and more appropriate CR for Marvel's premier villain, superior action economy with 3 attacks, more creative reactions like Deflection Matrix, and the Doombot Deception sidebar adds excellent DM utility—all while maintaining proper 5e formatting.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gemini_claude_gemini: More complete 5e formatting with detailed lair action mechanics (AC/HP for barriers, gas duration), includes Arcane Savant trait to properly justify the +22 Arcana, offers better tactical variety with 3 attacks and an Electrified Jab legendary action, and the Personal Force Field is more balanced than the second version's option to completely negate magical damage.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: The first statblock is far more thematically complete—including Doombots, lair actions, the Doombot Deception sidebar, dual concentration befitting a Sorcerer Supreme rival, and 'Ruler of Latveria'—while maintaining proper 5e formatting and a CR 25 that accurately reflects its offensive/defensive capabilities, whereas the second lacks key Doom identity elements and feels like a generic tech-wizard.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: While both are solid CR 22 statblocks, gpt_gpt_gemini uses modern monster-style spellcasting (at-will/daily) that's easier to run, has better defensive balance with higher HP and poison immunity, and features more mechanically interesting reactions (Spell Turning is excellent) and signature abilities (Mystic-Scientific Beam), making it a more playable and balanced boss encounter.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_claude: Superior 5e design with complete lair actions for Castle Doom, better CR accuracy (dual concentration in the other breaks fundamental 5e balance), included Doombot statblock, and more thematically comprehensive representation of Doom as both sorcerer and monarch.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: Includes essential flight capability, thematic Doombot summoning, and stays within standard 5e design conventions, while the other statblock lacks flight entirely and introduces problematic homebrew mechanics like dual concentration and multiple reactions per round that break 5e's action economy.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: The Doombot Decoy ability is an iconic Doctor Doom feature that brilliantly captures his character, the simplified X/day spellcasting is more playable than tracking full spell slots, the inclusion of lair actions adds excellent encounter design options for Castle Doom, and abilities like Diplomatic Immunity and Tactical Genius better represent his genius-level intellect and status as a head of state.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat claude_gpt_gemini: Better 5e formatting compliance (claude_gpt_gemini includes 'Technology' which isn't a 5e skill), more accurate CR 20 rating versus the bloated CR 25, and more balanced design—the Superior Counterspell auto-succeeding on 5th level spells 3/day and at-will bonus action teleportation in the other statblock create frustrating play patterns.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_claude: While the CR 25 version is more thematically comprehensive with lair actions and Doombot stats, it has significant balance issues including redundant save-negation features (Indomitable Will stacking with Legendary Resistance), free unlimited shield/counterspell casting, and improper spell list formatting showing multiple 9th-level spells; the CR 21 version is cleaner, more accurately balanced for its CR, and follows standard 5e design conventions more faithfully.

## Round 4

- **claude_gemini_claude** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat claude_gpt_gpt: While claude_gpt_gpt includes a valuable full Doombot statblock, it has an incorrect proficiency bonus (+8 instead of +7 for CR 25) and a confusingly worded stun effect; claude_claude_claude has correct math, properly noted expertise, thematically appropriate dual concentration mechanics with limitations, and cleaner condition timing throughout.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: It has better CR 21 accuracy with balanced damage output and defensive abilities, correctly uses 'Spell Attack' for INT-based attacks (unlike gemini_gemini_gpt's awkward 'Weapon Attack' using INT), and appropriately gates Frightful Presence behind a recharge rather than allowing it free every multiattack, which would be excessively powerful.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gpt_claude_gpt: While more complex to run, it better captures Doctor Doom's supreme intellect (INT 28), mastery of sorcery (full spellcasting), and iconic traits through features like 'Ruler of Latveria,' the Technomantic Assault legendary action, and the excellent Doombot Deception sidebar—all appropriate for a CR 25 threat of Doom's Marvel stature.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat claude_gpt_claude: While both are thematically strong, gemini_claude_gpt maintains better mechanical balance for CR 20, adheres more closely to standard 5e conventions (no dual concentration or at-will shield), uses familiar spell slot progression, and references existing statblocks (Helmed Horror) for easier play, whereas claude_gpt_claude's stacking defenses, unprecedented dual concentration, and various damage mitigation layers push it into problematic territory even for CR 25.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_gpt: While claude_gemini_gpt has better thematic elements (flight, doombots, lair actions), it contains mathematical errors (+25 Arcana should be +17), an excessively high DC 25, at-will 5th-level counterspell that's potentially game-breaking, and spell slot formatting issues—making gpt_gpt_claude the more mechanically sound, properly formatted, and balanced choice despite lacking flight.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat claude_gemini_gemini: While claude_gemini_gemini has superior thematic flavor with lair actions and Doombot features, it has critical mechanical issues: at-will counterspell that auto-succeeds on 5th level or lower is game-breaking, 'Technology' is not a valid 5e skill, and the stacking of Force Field (50 temp HP + resistance to ALL damage), armor regeneration, at-will shield, AND Legendary/Indomitable Will creates absurdly overtuned defenses even for CR 25; gpt_gpt_gemini is cleaner, more balanced, and follows proper 5e conventions.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_claude: The claude_claude_gpt statblock is more complete with essential lair actions befitting Doctor Doom's iconic Castle Doom, better-structured action economy (separating bonus actions properly), more thematic abilities like Technomantic Assault and the Doombot Deception sidebar for DM guidance, and superior formatting—making it a more playable and fitting boss encounter despite slightly higher complexity.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gpt_claude_claude: The Gemini version has superior playability with clearer lair action mechanics (specific AC/HP for duplicates, DC 25 for doors), a more thematic exploding Doombot Decoy, and the 3/day Counterspell Protocol is more practical for a CR 23 boss fight than the 1/day version.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat gemini_claude_gemini: It provides more complete and playable mechanics including detailed lair action specifications (barrier HP/AC, gas cloud duration and effects), the thematically appropriate exploding Doombot mechanic, and an additional legendary action option (Electrified Grasp), all while maintaining proper 5e formatting and a more accurate CR 20 rating for its defensive capabilities.
- **gpt_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: It uses modern 5e monster spellcasting conventions (X/day rather than spell slots), has properly limited abilities (Counterspell Protocol 3/day vs. the unlimited Power Siphon in the alternative), and offers cleaner playability while maintaining thematic accuracy through features like Spell Turning and Tactical Genius.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gemini_claude: While both capture Doom thematically, gemini_gpt_claude is more accurately CR'd and mechanically balanced; the other statblock stacks overpowered abilities (dual concentration, extra reactions per round, free 5th-level counterspells, and effectively 483+ HP via Doombot Decoy) that push it well beyond CR 22 and violate core 5e design principles.
- **gemini_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: Flight is an absolutely essential, iconic ability for Doctor Doom that the other statblock completely lacks; additionally, this version includes thematic Doombot summoning, a higher INT score befitting Marvel's greatest genius, cleaner 5e-standard mechanics, and a more manageable complexity level for actual play.
- **gpt_gemini_gemini** beat claude_gpt_gemini: While claude_gpt_gemini includes appealing thematic elements like Doombots and lair actions, it has significant 5e formatting errors ("Technology" is not a valid skill), inflated statistics (Int 28, DC 25, +17 to hit are excessive even for CR 25), and the CR 22 statblock provides better mechanical balance with properly calculated values and cleaner adherence to 5e conventions.

## Round 5

- **claude_gpt_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gemini_gpt_gpt: The claude statblock better captures Doctor Doom's iconic status with appropriately epic CR 25 design, comprehensive lair actions, superior thematic features (dual concentration representing magical mastery, Ruler of Latveria, Doombot Deception sidebar), and richer tactical options, while the gemini statblock, though cleaner, feels underwhelming for such a legendary villain with its lower CR 21 and missing lair actions.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gpt: While both are competent, claude_claude_gemini better captures Doctor Doom's thematic identity with superior trait design (Ruler of Latveria, Armor of Doom, Doombot Deception sidebar), more creative abilities (Deflection Matrix, Technomantic Assault), and tighter 5e formatting; gemini_claude_gpt has mechanical oddities like a reaction triggered by an HP threshold and unexplained 10 ft reach on a Medium humanoid's melee attack.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: The CR 25 statblock far better captures Doctor Doom's identity with thematic features like Doombots (with their own statblock), Castle Doom lair actions, Iron Resolve, and the brilliant Doombot Deception sidebar, while also following proper 5e formatting conventions including full spell slot spellcasting and comprehensive defensive/offensive mechanics appropriate for the CR.
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_claude: The gemini version better captures Doctor Doom's iconic elements—flight (essential), Doombots (thematically perfect), Indomitable Will with mind blank effects (representing his legendary iron will), and Frightful Presence—while the gpt version, despite cleaner formatting, critically omits Doom's signature ability to fly, which is a major thematic oversight for the character.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_gpt: It better captures Doctor Doom's supreme mastery with dual concentration, stronger damage output matching CR 25, more tactical depth through reactions like Deflection Matrix and Superior Counterspell, and excellent thematic touches like Ruler of Latveria and the Doombot Deception sidebar, while gpt_claude_gpt's damage output is undertuned for its CR 23 rating.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat claude_gpt_claude: While both are thematic, gpt_claude_gemini is more mechanically balanced—claude_gpt_claude breaks 5e design with at-will shield, dual concentration, regeneration, AND spell damage reduction stacked together, plus an incorrect +25 Arcana skill, making it far too defensively overtuned for its CR and less playable.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: This statblock better captures Doctor Doom's essence with essential Doombots, contingency protocols reflecting his 'always prepared' nature, the Vector Trap for imprisoning enemies, and proper lair actions befitting a major villain—all critical thematic elements missing from the competitor, whose lack of Doombots is a significant omission for any Doom statblock.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_gpt: While claude_gemini_gpt has excellent flavor (lair actions, Doombot stats, ruler trait), it suffers from severe balance issues: at-will 5th-level counterspell is broken, 120+ damage/round multiattack exceeds CR 25 expectations, and stacking Legendary Resistance with Indomitable Will plus regeneration plus Force Field creates an unplayably overpowered creature, whereas gemini_gpt_claude delivers a challenging but fair CR 21 with proper 5e balance.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: Superior thematic representation with Doombot mechanics, Castle Doom lair actions, and 'Ruler of Latveria' feature; more complete high-CR villain design with appropriate legendary actions and defensive layering; while gpt_gemini_gemini is cleaner, it lacks lair actions expected for a CR 22+ villain and has a grammatical error in Spell Turning.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: It avoids redundancy in Indomitable Will (not repeating immunities already listed), includes maze as an additional 8th-level spell for appropriate versatility, uses correct 5e language conventions ('can't' vs 'cannot'), and lacks the grammatical error ('the Doom') present in the other statblock's Frightful Presence.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat gemini_claude_gemini: The Doombot Decoy feature is thematically perfect and mechanically memorable, the streamlined X/day spellcasting is easier to run at the table, and it avoids the skill calculation error (Arcana +22) present in the other statblock while maintaining better CR accuracy for a legendary villain.
- **gemini_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_claude: While both capture Doom thematically, gpt_gemini_claude stacks too many overpowered defensive features (dual concentration, Spell Turning, Reactive Protocols, and Doombot Decoy effectively giving 483+ HP) that push it well beyond CR 22, whereas gemini_gpt_gemini maintains better mechanical balance with clear, playable abilities that accurately fit the listed challenge rating.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: Superior thematic representation (includes Doombots, lair actions, 'Ruler of Latveria' trait, Doombot Deception sidebar), better adherence to 5e conventions, while the competitor's 'Dual Concentration Matrix' and 'Paradox Reflexes' are non-standard mechanics that break core 5e design principles and create table confusion despite appearing simpler.

## Round 6

- **gpt_gemini_gpt** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: The claude statblock better captures Doctor Doom's identity as Marvel's premier villain with essential lair actions for Castle Doom, the brilliant Doombot Deception sidebar, thematic dual concentration representing his supreme sorcery, and a CR 25 rating that appropriately reflects his cosmic-tier threat level—elements the gemini version lacks despite its cleaner formatting.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_gemini: Uses the correct +8 proficiency bonus for CR 25, includes a complete Doombot statblock for practical use, has more balanced mechanics (limited Force Field uses, repeated saves on stun), and adds thematically appropriate condition immunities (charmed, frightened, paralyzed) that perfectly represent Doom's legendary willpower.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_gpt: While both are thematically strong, gemini_gpt_gpt is more mechanically balanced for its CR, follows cleaner 5e conventions, and avoids problematic rule-breaking abilities like dual concentration and at-will shield that make claude_claude_gpt's CR 25 assessment questionable and potentially unplayable.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gpt: The Doombot Decoy mechanic is brilliantly thematic, perfectly capturing Doom's contingency planning, while the Mystic-Scientific Beam elegantly represents his fusion of magic and technology; additionally, the lair actions are more evocative of Castle Doom, and the overall design avoids problematic elements like the +22 skill bonus and the potentially game-breaking Vector Trap teleportation in the other version.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat gpt_gpt_claude: Superior thematic representation with Doombots, contingency protocols, Power Siphon, and lair actions that capture Doom's essence; more accurate CR 20 rating for its actual offensive/defensive output; and INT 26 properly reflects Marvel's supreme genius, while the opponent lacks iconic elements like Doombots entirely.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_claude: While both are solid, gpt_gpt_gemini has cleaner action economy, better balanced abilities (the Vector Trap no-concentration banishment legendary action in the other is too powerful), correctly calculated skills (the +22 Arcana is wrong or unexplained), and the streamlined spellcasting format is more playable while still capturing Doom's sorcerer-scientist identity.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_gemini: While the second statblock has creative additions like lair actions and the Doombot deception sidebar, it has significant issues: at-will counterspell with auto-success on 5th level or lower is broken, the 'Technology' skill doesn't exist in 5e, and the stacking of 50 temp HP + resistance to ALL damage as a bonus action combined with at-will shield makes this creature far too defensive and frustrating to fight, likely exceeding its stated CR 25.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_claude: Features cleaner 5e formatting (proficiency on CR line, resistances properly consolidated), a more balanced Doombot Decoy that drops to 1 HP instead of half-max (which would be overpowered), and a more elegant Holographic Duplicates lair action that auto-destroys on misses rather than requiring an action economy tax.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: The first statblock provides a more complete and thematic Doctor Doom with essential elements like lair actions for Castle Doom, a proper Doombot statblock, the iconic Doombot Deception sidebar, unique features like dual concentration and spell damage reduction, and better CR 25 accuracy for a character of Doom's power level, while the second statblock feels like a more generic armored wizard lacking signature Doom elements and lair support.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: Despite some mechanical quirks (like the impossible +25 Arcana), it better captures Doctor Doom with essential flight capability, thematic lair actions for Castle Doom, included Doombot statblock, and the iconic Summon Doombots ability—making it a more complete and usable package for running the character.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: Superior thematic representation with Doombot summoning, Doombot Deception sidebar, and Castle Doom lair actions, plus better CR-appropriate power level, more accurate math, and Doom's INT 28 properly reflecting his status as one of Marvel's greatest intellects.
- **gemini_claude_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: This statblock better captures Doctor Doom's character with appropriate lair actions (essential for a villain in his fortress), the thematic Contingency Protocol escape mechanic, and more balanced damage output (2d10+8 vs overpowered 4d10+8), while the Vector Trap's 3-action cost with recharge prevents abusive spamming compared to the first version's 2-action no-recharge banishment.
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_claude: While both capture Doom's essence, claude_gpt_gemini provides a more complete package with excellent lair actions (essential for Castle Doom), proper CR 25 scaling, better thematic abilities (Ruler of Latveria, Doombot summoning, Technomantic Assault), whereas gpt_gemini_claude's dual concentration feature breaks fundamental 5e design rules and lacks lair actions entirely.

## Round 7

- **gpt_gemini_claude** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gpt_claude_gemini: The claude_claude_claude statblock better represents Doctor Doom with INT 28 (fitting Marvel's second-smartest human), a more appropriate CR 25, thematically perfect abilities like Indomitable Will and dual concentration for the Supreme Sorcerer, higher spell save DC (24), and handles the Doombot twist as an optional DM sidebar rather than a mandatory mechanic that could frustrate players.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gpt: The claude_gpt_gpt statblock offers superior thematic representation with its Doombot statblock, lair actions, and Doombot Deception sidebar, while also providing more accurate CR 25 math through layered defenses (damage reduction, regeneration, force field), higher damage output, and a richer action economy that better captures Doom's mastery of both magic and technology.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_claude: The CR 25 statblock better represents Doctor Doom's canonical power level with more comprehensive abilities (Disintegrator Beam, Technomantic Assault, superior defensive options), thematically appropriate features like Ruler of Latveria and the Doombot Deception sidebar, and higher damage output befitting Marvel's premier villain—while the CR 20 version's base damage (~38/round from Multiattack) is significantly underpowered for its rating.
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: While gpt_gpt_gemini has cleaner math, gemini_gemini_gpt better captures Doctor Doom's identity with iconic Doombots, Frightful Presence, Indomitable Will (perfect for his iron willpower), INT 26 representing his supreme genius, traditional 5e spell slots for a 20th-level caster, and creative abilities like Power Siphon and Vector Trap that create a more dynamic boss encounter.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_claude_gpt: While claude_claude_gpt has richer flavor, it is mechanically overtuned for CR 25 with dual concentration (a problematic homebrew mechanic), excessive defensive stacking (regeneration + deflection matrix + shield at will + bonus action temp HP), and damage output (~126/round) that exceeds its stated CR; gemini_gpt_claude is more accurately balanced for CR 21, uses cleaner 5e design principles, and is significantly more playable at the table.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat claude_gpt_claude: While both are thematically strong, gpt_claude_gpt adheres better to 5e conventions—claude_gpt_claude breaks core rules with dual concentration, has inflated stats (DC 25 saves, +25 Arcana, shield at-will), and is overtuned beyond its CR 25 rating, making gpt_claude_gpt more mechanically balanced and playable.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_claude: Superior thematic representation with Doombots, Castle Doom lair actions, and Doom's full wizard spellcasting mastery, plus the second statblock has a damage calculation error (Doomfist shows +6 damage with only STR +4) and lacks iconic Doom elements like his signature robot decoys.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat claude_gemini_gemini: Claude's version includes a complete, usable Doombot statblock for the Summon Doombots ability and the Arcane Mastery trait, while Gemini's version has the non-standard 'Technology' skill (not a valid 5e skill) and lazily references shield guardian stats with modifications, making it less playable.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_claude: Superior thematic representation with lair actions for Castle Doom, custom Doombot statblock, the iconic Doombot Deception sidebar, and better CR-appropriate power level (CR 25 fits Doom better than CR 21), plus more tactical depth through varied legendary actions and the Ruler of Latveria trait.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat claude_gpt_gemini: Better balanced for CR 23 with accurate defensive/offensive math, uses modern 5e formatting conventions (X/day spellcasting), avoids the non-standard 'Technology' skill, and the stun-on-hit combined with DC 25 saves in the other statblock creates balance issues that push it well beyond CR 25.
- **gemini_claude_gemini** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: Superior thematic representation with Doombots, essential lair actions for Castle Doom, full 20th-level spellcasting befitting Marvel's supreme sorcerer, and tactical features like Contingency Protocol and Vector Trap that capture Doom's strategic genius—while the other statblock inexplicably omits Doombots entirely and lacks lair actions critical to the character's identity.
- **gemini_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: While both capture Doom thematically, gpt_gemini_gpt breaks fundamental 5e design principles with Dual Concentration Matrix and Paradox Reflexes (reaction every turn), making it significantly overpowered for CR 22; gemini_gpt_gemini maintains proper 5e conventions, includes proficiency bonus, has cleaner formatting, and achieves similar thematic depth (Doombots, Vector Trap, Mind Blank) without breaking core game mechanics.
- **gpt_gemini_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: While gemini's version has thematically excellent Doombots and flight, gpt's statblock is mechanically tighter with better action economy (bonus action teleport, Reactive trait), superior offensive options (combat cantrips, Mystic-Scientific Beam), the creative Spell Turning feature, and fewer math errors (gemini's Arcana +22 is mathematically impossible without expertise).
