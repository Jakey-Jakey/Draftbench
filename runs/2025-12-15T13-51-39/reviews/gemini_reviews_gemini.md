Here is a review of the **Doctor Doom** statblock.

### **Overview**
**Overall Impression:** This is a solid representation of Doctor Doom. You have captured the essence of the character: a blend of technological mastery, supreme magical ability, and arrogance. The statblock leans heavily into the "Wizard Boss" archetype.

**Challenge Rating Assessment:**
Currently, this is a **Soft CR 21**. While his defensive CR is high (AC 22 + Magic Resistance + Shield + Counterspell), his offensive CR is heavily reliant on spell selection. His base "resourceless" damage (Arcane Gauntlets) is quite low for Tier 4 play. A party of level 17-20 adventurers could likely burst him down in 2 rounds unless played exceedingly tactically.

### **Detailed Feedback**

#### **1. Thematics & Characterization**
*   **The Vibe:** You nailed the "God-King" feel. High AC, flying/hovering, immunity to mind-reading (**Indomitable Will/Mind Blank**), and *Frightful Presence* all fit perfectly.
*   **The Tech/Magic Split:** Currently, the statblock feels 80% Wizard / 20% Armored Artificer. Doom should feel like he has answers even when in an *Antimagic Field*. Giving him more technological actions (tech-based weaponry that isn't a spell attack) would solidify this duality.

#### **2. Mechanical Balance & Numbers**
*   **Hit Points (247):** This is low for a solo CR 21 boss. A level 20 Paladin or Fighter can output 100+ damage in a single turn. With only 247 HP, Doom might die before using his cool spells.
    *   *Recommendation:* Increase Hit Dice to 30d8 + 150 (**Average 285**) or give him a "Force Field" (Temporary HP) mechanic that recharges to represent his armor's shielding.
*   **Damage Output:**
    *   **Arcane Gauntlets:** 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage is very low. Even doing this twice (38 damage), it pales in comparison to a level 17 Warlock casting *Eldritch Blast* (4 beams). For a CR 21 creature, the "At-Will" attack should feel impactful.
    *   *Recommendation:* Increase damage to **4d10+8** or allow him to fire **four beams** (like a high-level warlock) distributed among targets.
*   **Skills:** Calculating +7 proficiency and +8 INT yields +15. Your Arcana makes him an "Expert" (+22). This is mathematically correct and flavorfully perfect.

#### **3. Action Economy**
*   **Summon Doombot:**
    *   *Issue:* A stock **Helmed Horror** (CR 4, ~60 HP) is irrelevant in a CR 21 battle. Tier 4 AOE spells or a single Fighter swing will destroy it instantly.
    *   *Recommendation:* Use the Helmed Horror stats, but give the Doombot the **"Minion" trait** (E.g., *Self-Destruct Sequence*: When reduced to 0 HP, it explodes for 4d10 fire damage) or allow him to summon **1d3** of them. They are there to eat actions, not deal damage; make the players regret killing them in melee.
*   **Power Siphon (Reaction):**
    *   This is a great ability. It serves as both defense and sustain. However, tying it to a spell slot makes it resource-heavy. Since he is CR 21, consider making this a recharge ability (Recharge 5-6) that functions as a Counterspell *without* using a slot, or keep it as-is but clarify if he needs the specific slot level available.

#### **4. Spells & Legendary Actions**
*   **Spell List:** *Time Stop, Forcecage, Wall of Force*. This is the "Optimal Wizard" list. It creates a very binary fight: if the DM plays Doom smartly, the Fighter ends up in a Forcecage and the Wizard gets Counterspelled, leading to a frustration spiral. This is accurate to Doom, just be aware it can be unfun to play against.
*   **Redundancy:** He casts *Mind Blank* (8th level) daily, which grants immunity to psychic damage, mind reading, and charming. He also has **Indomitable Will** and **Damage Immunities**, which do the exact same thing.
    *   *Fix:* You can remove *Mind Blank* from his prepared list to free up a slot, or keep it there to explain *why* he has those immunities.
*   **Legendary Action: Vector Trap (3 Actions):**
    *   *The Danger:* "Teleported to a location... within 1 mile" is effectively **removing a player from the session**. If you teleport the Paladin into a dungeon cell a mile away, that player drives home early.
    *   *Fix:* Change this to *Banishment* mechanics (pop to a demiplane for 1 minute while concentrating) OR teleport them 60 feet into the air (fall damage) or into a hazardous spot on the battlefield. Do not split the party by 1 mile during combat.

### **Actionable Edit Recommendations**

Here are the specific changes to bring this to a polished "WotC Official" standard:

1.  **Buff the HP:** Increase to **285 (30d8 + 150)**.
2.  **Combine Immunities:** Remove *Mind Blank* from the spell list and just bake the effects fully into **Indomitable Will**, noting that it functions "as if under the effect of a *mind blank* spell."
3.  **Refactor "Arcane Gauntlets":**
    > ***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) force damage.
4.  **Refactor "Summon Doombots":**
    > ***Summon Doombots (Recharge 6).*** Doom summons 1d3 Doombots (use Helmed Horror statistics) to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. A Doombot acts on Doom's initiative count. When a Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
5.  **Fix "Vector Trap":**
    > **Vector Trap (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a pocket dimension (as per the *banishment* spell, no concentration required) until the end of Doom's next turn.

### **Final Verdict**
This is a very strong foundation. With the damage output tweaked upward and the "Save or Bye-Bye" teleportation mechanic adjusted for table enjoyment, this will be a memorable encounter worthy of the ruler of Latveria.
