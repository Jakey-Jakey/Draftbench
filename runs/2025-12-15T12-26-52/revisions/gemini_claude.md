# gemini's Statblock (revised by claude)

Here is the revised, balanced, and polished statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

### Design Notes & Changes
*   **CR adjustment:** Tuned to a solid **CR 25**.
*   **Mythic Mechanic:** The "Doombot Decoy" is now a proper Mythic Trait ("The Master's Contingency"). This splits the fight into two phases (approx. 350 HP first phase, 190 HP second phase), solving the "infinite resource" issue while preserving the cinematic reveal.
*   **Action Economy:** "Shield" at will is retained, but the stacking "Tech-Shield" reaction was removed to prevent AC 32 scenarios. He must choose between defense (*Shield*) or disruption (*Counterspell*) for his Reaction.
*   **Number Tweak:** Spell Save DC reduced to **24** and Attack Bonus to **+16**. This is mathematically appropriate for Tier 4 adventurers without being mathematically impossible for non-optimized characters.
*   **Mind Transfer:** Codified as a "last resort" escape mechanic that doesn't permanently remove a player from the campaign without a save.
*   **Double Concentration:** Retained but clarified.

**_Dual Concentration._** Doom can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time. He makes a separate Constitution saving throw for each spell if he takes damage.

**_Indomitable Will._** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or detect his location via divination magic. He is immune to effects that would alter his memory or personality.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)._** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**_Magic Resistance._** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Master of Science._** Doom relies on technology as much as magic. He is proficient with tinker's tools and smith's tools. His armor filters toxins (granting immunity to poison) and grounds electricity (granting immunity to lightning).

**_The Master's Contingency (Mythic Trait)._** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, the damage reveals the body to be an advanced Doombot. The body explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
The *real* Doctor Doom (or a secondary battle-frame) teleports into the space previously occupied by the Doombot (or the nearest unoccupied space). This new form has 190 hit points and 20 temporary hit points. He retains his initiative count and any spell slots he had remaining, but he is freed of any conditions he was suffering. When this trait activates, Doom regains all expended Legendary Actions.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes three Arcane Gauntlet attacks. He can substitute one Arcane Gauntlet attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**_Arcane Gauntlet._** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) force damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**_Frightful Presence._** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Ovoid Mind Transfer (Recharge 6)._** Doom targets one incapacitated humanoid within 30 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be possessed. Doom's body becomes inert, and his consciousness moves into the target's body. Doom retains his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as his class features and proficiencies, but otherwise adopts the target's statistics. The possession lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, Doom ends it as a bonus action, or doom is forced out by an effect like *dispel good and evil*.

**_Spellcasting._** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). Doom can cast *shield* and *misty step* at will. He has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, prestidigitation, shocking grasp, toll the dead*
*   1st level (4 slots): *dissonant whispers, detect magic, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, scorching ray*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt, fly*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
*   5th level (3 slots): *animate objects, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, reverse gravity*
*   8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Reactions

**_Diplomatic Immunity._** When a creature Doom can see hits him with an attack, Doom imposes disadvantage on the attack roll, referencing the laws of Latveria (or standard arrogance). If the attack still hits, Doom can immediately move up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**_Shield / Counterspell._** Doom uses his reaction to cast *shield* (at will) or *counterspell* (using a spell slot) when the trigger conditions are met.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Assault.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Tactical Reposition.** Doom allows his armor's jets to carry him up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower that has a casting time of 1 action.
*   **Kneel (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *command* (at 5th level, DC 24) without expending a spell slot.

### Mythic Actions

If Doom's **The Master's Contingency** trait has activated in the last hour, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

*   **Gauntlet Overcharge.** Doom makes two Arcane Gauntlet attacks.
*   **Annihilation Beam (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom fires a beam of concentrated energy in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
*   **Absolute Authority (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *hold person* or *telekinesis* without expending a spell slot.

***

### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Security Turrets.** Doom activates automated defenses. He makes two ranged spell attacks (+16 to hit) against creatures of his choice within 120 feet. *Hit:* 22 (4d10) force damage.
*   **Arcane Nullification.** Doom activates a dampening field. All creatures within 60 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 24 Intelligence saving throw or lose concentration on any spells they are currently maintaining.
*   **Sealed Exits.** Heavy vibranium shutters slam down over all doors and windows in the lair. These are magically reinforced (AC 23, 100 HP, immunity to all damage except force and adamantine weapons). *Passwall* and similar magic fail on these barriers.

### Revisions Explained

1.  **Stats & Math:** The Spell Save DC was lowered from 26 to **24** and the To Hit from +18 to **+16**. This adheres to the standard math for a CR 25 creature (PB +8, Ability +8) while still being formidable.
2.  **HP & Mythic Trait:** The original "Doombot Decoy" reaction was game-breaking (full heal on a reaction). This was converted to a **Mythic Trait**. He now effectively has ~540 HP total across two phases, which fits the DMG guidelines for CR 25 perfectly.
3.  **Spellcasting Limits:**
    *   *Shield* is still at-will, but he must choose between using his Reaction for *Shield* or *Counterspell*. He cannot do both in the same round.
    *   The Legendary Action "Cast a Spell" is now restricted to spells with a casting time of 1 action, preventing abuse of reaction spells or long-cast spells.
4.  **Mind Transfer:** This was moved to an Action with a Recharge. It targets *incapacitated* creatures, making it a finisher or a combo with *Hold Person/Power Word Stun*, rather than a "save or die" at the start of the fight.
5.  **Skill Cleanup:** "Technology" is not a standard skill; replaced with appropriate Tool proficiencies and flavor text.
6.  **Lair Actions:** Turrets clarified to be spell attacks (tech-magical) rather than weapon attacks to utilize his high attack bonus logic. Added "Sealed Exits" to emphasize his control over the battlefield.
