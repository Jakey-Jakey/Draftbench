***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom's armor can't be removed against his will. While he wears it, Doom has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and he can't be disarmed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks):

At will: *detect magic*, *fire bolt*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *ray of frost*, *shocking grasp*

3/day each: *dispel magic*, *lightning bolt*, *mirror image*, *misty step*, *wall of force*

2/day each: *disintegrate*, *dominate person*, *greater invisibility*

1/day each: *dominate monster*, *teleport*, *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks using Doomfist Strike, Arcane Gauntlet Blast, or a combination of the two.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (5d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly away from Doom.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

---

## Bonus Actions

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

---

## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no spell slot or material components.

***Spell Turning (3/Day).*** When Doom is targeted by a spell that targets only him (not an area) and he succeeds on the saving throw or the spell attack misses, Doom can force the spell to target the caster instead, using the same saving throw DC or attack roll. Doom can't use this reaction if he used Legendary Resistance to succeed on the saving throw.

---

**Commanding Step.** Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
