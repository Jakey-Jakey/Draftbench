***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Armored Targeting Suite.*** While wearing his battle suit, Doom can use Intelligence instead of Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with his gauntlet and suit weapons.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 30 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points don’t stack with themselves.

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom’s attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage. Additionally, Doom can concentrate on up to two spells at once. When Doom takes damage, he makes a single Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on both spells (DC 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher). On a failure, Doom loses concentration on both spells.

***Mastermind’s Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to his initiative rolls.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom can understand all spoken languages.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks: one with **Gauntlet Strike** and two with **Eldritch Blast**. He can replace one **Eldritch Blast** with casting a spell.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) lightning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be **stunned** until the start of Doom’s next turn.

***Eldritch Blast.*** Doom fires four beams of force. *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target per beam. *Hit:* 15 (1d10 + 10) force damage per beam.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing a wave of crushing gravity and domination. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 60 feet of him must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *telekinesis, wall of force*
- **6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, disintegrate*
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*
- **8th level (1 slot):** *maze*
- **9th level (1 slot):** *meteor swarm, time stop*

## Reactions

***Siphon Power (Recharge 5–6).*** When Doom sees a creature within 60 feet of him casting a spell, he attempts to interrupt it.
- If the creature is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell fails and has no effect.
- If the creature is casting a spell of 6th level or higher, Doom makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell’s level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

If Doom successfully interrupts the spell, he fires one beam of **Eldritch Blast** at the spell’s caster as part of this reaction.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Relocation.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.  
**Arcane Beam.** Doom fires two beams of **Eldritch Blast**.  
**Overcharge Gauntlet (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one **Gauntlet Strike** attack.  
**War Magic (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his prepared spells (casting time of 1 action).

## Mythic Trait

***Doombot Protocol (Mythic Trait; 1/Day).*** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn’t die or fall unconscious. Instead, his current body is revealed as an armored construct and detonates. Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then Doom reappears in an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet, regains 200 hit points, ends all conditions on himself, and **Kneel Before Doom** immediately recharges. Doom doesn’t regain expended spell slots.
