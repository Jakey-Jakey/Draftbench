  "reasoning": "B is the strongest overall package: solid 5e structure, controlled action economy (2 attacks, limited DR, doombot spawn on recharge), a clear mythic phase with restrained escalation, and well-built lair/regional play—only notable knock is a few math/consistency slips (notably HP formula vs Con). E is the best ‘single-sheet’ Doom: clearer counterplay, fewer hard-lock controls (restrained instead of paralyzed), and a reasonable mythic bump; its main issue is an at-will 50-point spell damage reduction reaction that can overly punish caster parties without usage limits. H/A/F are the best of the CR 23 versions; H leads due to cleaner reactions-per-day structure, an explicit weakness that creates player agency, and integrated doombot rules. A is very playable but the extra-reactions trait plus strong defensive reactions pushes it upward in power. F has some good tuning but suffers from muddier balance/wording (notably an at-will defensive reaction and awkward legendary-action costs). I and G are thematically cool but drift into oppressive tier-4 lockout (high sustained DPR, heavy control, frequent doombots, strong defenses, and very aggressive mythic recharge behavior), with G also containing more rules/clarity issues. C and especially D break 5e expectations (antimagic immunity/tech-magic exceptions, at-will high-level effects/counterspell behavior, swingy ‘it was a doombot’ death logic, and mythic resets/slot recursion), making them the least balanced and least fun to run against."
