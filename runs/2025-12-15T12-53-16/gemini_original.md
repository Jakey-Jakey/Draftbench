# Original Statblock (gemini)

Here is a D&D 5th Edition statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

This design aims to capture Victor Von Doom’s duality as a supreme sorcerer and a peerless scientist. He is designed as a Challenge Rating 24 "campaign ender," suitable for a party of level 17–20 adventurers.

He features high AC (Powered Armor), immense spellcasting versatility, and a unique mechanic involving his signature **Doombots**.

**Scientific Sorcery.** Doom’s armor and magic are intertwined. He ignores the verbal and somatic components of spells, and his spellcasting cannot be prevented by an *Antimagic Field* unless the field also suppresses technological items.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Indomitable Ego.** Doom makes all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws with advantage.

**The Doombot Protocol.** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a roll of 11 or higher, the body sparks and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The true Doom reveals himself to have been watching from afar, or teleports to a space within 300 feet (DM's discretion), with half his hit points remaining. This trait cannot function if Doom is incapacitated or if *Dispel Magic* was cast on him as a 9th-level spell before he dropped to 0 HP.

***

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two Arcane Gauntlet attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting.

**Arcane Gauntlet.** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.

**Molecular Disruption (Recharge 5–6).** Doom emits a wave of destabilizing energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed.

**Spellcasting.** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (Spell Save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks):
*   **At will:** *Detect Magic, Mage Hand, Shield, Misty Step, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt (5th level)*
*   **3/day each:** *Wall of Force, Disintegrate, Telekinesis*
*   **1/day each:** *Power Word Stun, Plane Shift, Time Stop, Meteor Swarm*

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons 1d4 **Doombots** (use *Helmed Horror* statistics, but with a fly speed of 60 ft. and the ability to cast *Eldritch Blast* as a 5th-level caster) to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They obey his verbal commands and act immediately after his turn.

***

### Reactions

**Techno-Magical Absorption.** When Doom is targeted by a spell that deals damage or includes a magical energy attack (such as a dragon's breath weapon), he can use his reaction to activate his armor's siphon. He takes no damage from the attack and regains hit points equal to half the damage rolled.

***

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Reposition.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts *Command* (at 5th level) or uses his gravitational generators to force obedience. Each enemy within 30 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and immediately end their turn.
*   **Absolute Power (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom recharges his *Molecular Disruption* or regains a 3/day spell slot.

## Dungeon Master Notes: Playing Doctor Doom

**The Personality**
Victor Von Doom is not a murder-hobo; he is a monarch. He speaks in the third person. He is arrogant because he genuinely believes he is superior to every other being in the multiverse. In combat, he should focus on the smartest character first (the Wizard or Artificer) to prove his intellectual dominance, or the character with the highest Charisma to prove his dominance of will.

**Tactics**
*   **Defense First:** Doom rarely enters melee voluntarily. He flies 30-60 feet above the battlefield.
*   **Action Economy:** He uses *Time Stop* immediately if threatened to set up *Wall of Force* (trapping the healer or melee fighter) and position himself.
*   **Counter-Play:** His reaction, *Techno-Magical Absorption*, is devastating against blasters. Describe it not as dodging, but as the armor glowing and drinking the energy.
*   **The Switch:** Use the *Doombot Protocol* to mess with your players' heads. If they "kill" him too easily in round 2, it was definitely a Doombot.

**Lair Actions (Optional - Castle Doom)**
If fought in Latveria/Castle Doom, on initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom may use a Lair Action:
1.  **Defense Grid:** Turrets emerge from the walls, making attacks (+12 to hit) against all enemies.
2.  **Anti-Magic Field:** A specific 20ft square becomes an *Antimagic Field* until initiative count 20 on the next round. (Doom’s tech still works there).
3.  **Diplomatic Immunity:** Doom chooses one creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 25 Charisma save or be unable to attack Doom until the end of their next turn.
