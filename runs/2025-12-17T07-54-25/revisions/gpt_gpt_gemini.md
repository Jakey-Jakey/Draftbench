### Traits

**Arcane Expertise.** Doom adds double his proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) checks (included above).

**Doom Armor.** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. His weapon attacks are magical.

**Force Field Matrix.** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he gains 15 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Master of Magic and Machine.** When Doom casts a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or force damage, he can change that damage type to another type from that list.

**Mastermind’s Preparedness.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

**Spellcasting.** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). Doom requires no material components to cast his spells, unless the components have a gold piece cost. He can cast spells while wearing his Doom armor.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two attacks, using Doomfist or Gauntlet Blast in any combination.

**Doomfist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Gauntlet Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) force damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**Arcane Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom releases a surging wave of technomagical force in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons 1d2 constructs in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. Each summoned construct uses the **helmed horror** stat block, appears as a Doombot, and is under Doom’s control. The Doombots act on Doom’s initiative (immediately after his turn) and obey his telepathic commands. They vanish after 1 hour, when Doom is incapacitated, or when Doom dismisses them (no action).

---

### Reactions

**Redirective Shielding.** When Doom takes damage from a creature he can see within 60 feet, he reduces the damage by 15. If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can force the attacker to make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
