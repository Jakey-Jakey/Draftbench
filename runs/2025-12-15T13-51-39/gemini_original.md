***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Indomitable WIll.*** Doom is immune to effects that would alter his mind or read his thoughts unless he allows it.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
*   5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift*
*   8th level (1 slot): *mind blank* (cast daily), *power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of the Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombot (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons a Doombot (use **Helmed Horror** statistics with an Intelligence of 18) to an unoccupied space within 60 feet. The Doombot obeys Doom’s verbal commands and takes its turn immediately after his.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell, Doom can attempt to absorb the magic. As a reaction, he casts *counterspell* (using a 3rd level slot unless he chooses to expend a higher one). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell countered.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells.
*   **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a location Doom has prepared (such as a dungeon cell or into a *forcecage*) within 1 mile. If the destination is occupied, the spell fails.
