***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Blank.*** Doom is under the effects of the *mind blank* spell. He is immune to psychic damage, is immune to being charmed, and magic can’t read his thoughts or determine whether he is lying. Divination spells can’t target him or perceive him.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 20 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he has advantage on saving throws against being stunned.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components for his spells.

***Overclocked Concentration (1/Day).*** When Doom casts a spell that requires concentration, he can choose to overclock his armor to maintain concentration on that spell and one other spell he is already concentrating on, for up to 1 minute. While overclocking, Doom has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration, and if he fails such a saving throw, he loses concentration on both spells.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom understands all spoken languages. He can speak any language he has heard spoken for at least 1 minute.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

* **Cantrips (at will):** *eldritch blast (4 beams; armor-integrated emitter), mage hand, prestidigitation, word of radiance*
* **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
* **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
* **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*
* **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
* **5th level (3 slots):** *scrying, telekinesis, wall of force*
* **6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
* **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage (1/day), teleport*
* **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Gauntlet Blast or Titanium Gauntlet. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (3d6 + 9) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. This attack is magical.

***Arc-Furnace Pulse (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom releases a violent surge of crackling energy. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the save can’t take reactions until the start of Doom’s next turn.

---

## Reactions

***Power Siphon (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* without expending a spell slot. If the spell is countered, Doom regains one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower.

---

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Tactical Reposition.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 4th level or lower from his list of prepared spells.

***Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational and psychic dominance. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, is knocked prone, and is grappled (escape DC 21) until the end of Doom’s next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or grappled.
