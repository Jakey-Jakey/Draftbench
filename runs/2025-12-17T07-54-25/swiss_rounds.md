# Swiss Tournament Log

## Round 1

- **gemini_gemini_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat claude_claude_claude: S2 improves on S1 with better mechanical balance (Force Field recharge prevents temp HP spam, legendary action spellcasting excludes concentration spells) and a much cleaner Pride of Doom trait that uses clear 5e mechanics with defined range, duration, action economy cost, and a properly-worded goaded condition instead of vague DM fiat.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat claude_claude_gemini: S2 demonstrates tighter CR 24 accuracy with more restrained numbers, cleaner 5e formatting conventions, and elegant design choices like the Contingency escape and automatic Force Field Matrix that improve playability while maintaining Doom's thematic identity through features like Latverian Loyalty and Master of Magic and Machine.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_gemini: S1 is more mechanically complete with correct 20th-level spellcasting (matching the slot progression), includes Regional Effects for full lair treatment, has proper save mechanics on the Containment Protocol lair action, and provides clearer temp HP stacking rules throughout.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat gemini_claude_gpt: S1 has mathematically correct attack bonuses (+17) and spell save DCs (25) for INT 30 with +7 proficiency, while S2 incorrectly uses +15 and DC 23; S1 also follows standard 5e damage notation whereas S2's combined damage format ('2d8 + 6 plus 4d8') is non-standard and confusing.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat gemini_claude_gemini: S2 is mechanically tighter with proper 5e formatting, includes well-designed lair actions and regional effects that add depth, uses streamlined innate spellcasting for easier play, and avoids S1's problematic elements like automatic dual concentration, guaranteed 30 temp HP per turn, and the Doombot Contingency escape clause that frustratingly invalidates player victory.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gpt_gemini: S1 demonstrates better 5e design with properly limited reactions (Shield Protocol 3/Day, Power Absorption 1/Round), includes a complete standalone Doombot statblock for easier play, features a more tactically interesting AoE Electroshock, and adds the thematic Command Construct legendary action—whereas S2's unlimited Shield Protocol is problematic and its Doombot requires external reference to the helmed horror.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: S1 better captures Doctor Doom thematically with the Doombot Decoy reaction (an iconic Doom trait), higher Intelligence befitting Marvel's greatest genius, more tactical legendary action economy (Force Field Surge at 2 actions vs 3), and a fuller spell list with chain lightning and finger of death, while maintaining CR 23 appropriateness.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_gpt_claude: S1 has cleaner 5e formatting and more balanced mechanics; S2's Electro-Shock is awkwardly formatted (a recharge action that only triggers after another specific attack is non-standard), and Tactical Analysis granting both attack advantage AND save disadvantage as a bonus action every turn is significantly overtuned, making S1 the more mechanically sound and properly formatted statblock despite S2's excellent thematic mythic trait.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: S1 follows standard 5e spell slot conventions while S2's at-will 1st/2nd level spells (including Hold Person and Misty Step) breaks core 5e design principles and creates severe balance issues; S1 also has properly formatted mythic rules, more accurate CR, and reasonable DCs (23 vs 25) for playability.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat claude_gemini_claude: S2 has more appropriate lair action DCs (20 vs 18) for CR 24, cleaner reaction wording with explicit excess damage rules, better-balanced Electroshock (incapacitated vs stunned), limited Doombot deployment preventing action economy abuse, and removes the unbalanced spell slot recovery on Power Surge.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_claude: S1 offers superior thematic representation with excellent traits like Supreme Arrogance (Reed Richards rivalry), Diplomatic Immunity, and Indomitable Will that capture Doom's character; it has better CR accuracy with higher damage output (3-attack multiattack vs 2), more tactical depth through well-designed lair/regional effects, and the bonus action economy (teleport + temp HP) properly reflects a CR 24 threat.
- **gpt_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: S1 demonstrates superior 5e design by creating 'arcane blast' instead of awkwardly giving a warlock cantrip, clearly specifying temp HP replacement rules in Force Field Matrix, explicitly noting Doombots lack Spell Immunity, and using more precise reaction wording—whereas S2's ambiguous 'fly 60 ft. (via spell)' and unclear temp HP mechanics create playability issues.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: S1 has clearer multiattack structure (4 distinct Eldritch Blasts vs S2's confusing 4-beams-per-attack that yields 8 beams total), while S2 contains a formatting error listing two 9th-level spells (meteor swarm, time stop) with only one spell slot.

## Round 2

- **gemini_gemini_gpt** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_claude: S1 demonstrates superior 5e accuracy (correct spell slots vs S2's erroneous 2 8th-level slots), better thematic depth with the exploitable 'Pride of Doom' flaw befitting the character, more varied legendary actions, and cleaner traditional formatting while maintaining appropriate CR 24 threat level.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gemini_claude_claude: S1 adheres better to 5e bounded accuracy (DC 21 vs S2's DC 25), uses standard formatting conventions, and provides a more playable encounter without the potentially frustrating 'it was a Doombot' legendary action that can invalidate entire fights.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gpt_claude: S2 uses modern 5e spellcasting format with slots, includes a properly formatted separate Doombot statblock for easier play, features more thematic abilities like Command Construct and spell slot recovery via Power Absorption, and integrates spellcasting into the multiattack action—all reflecting current WotC design philosophy while offering superior table usability.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: S1 has correct 7th-level spell slot allocation (2 slots per standard 20th-level caster), includes the thematically excellent Doombot Decoy reaction, clarifies the maximum Doombot limit, and properly conditions Force Field Matrix to trigger only when lacking temp HP—while S2 incorrectly reduces 7th-level slots to 1 and uses non-standard formatting for innate flight speed.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gpt: S2 demonstrates superior 5e design with proper bonus action economy, thematically brilliant features (Wounded Pride with Reed Richards trigger, Diplomatic Immunity), complete lair actions and regional effects, and an included Doombot statblock that makes the Doombot Decoy reaction actually functional—all with cleaner standard formatting compared to S1's non-standard Initiative modifier and unusual +22 tool proficiency bonus.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: S1 provides a more complete boss encounter with essential lair actions and regional effects befitting Doom's iconic castle, includes characterful features like Supreme Arrogance and Diplomatic Immunity that capture his personality, has properly scaled CR 24 offensive/defensive numbers, and follows standard 5e legendary creature formatting—while S2's automatic 30 temp HP/turn with no action cost is mechanically unprecedented and the lack of lair actions is a significant omission for such an iconic lair-based villain.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: S1 has superior 5e formatting (proper lowercase spell names), includes crucial limitations on the Doombot Protocol (1d4 day cooldown and explicit non-restoration of spell slots), and provides clearer legendary action wording specifying casting time requirements—all of which improve playability and prevent exploits.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat claude_claude_claude: S2's Pride of Doom trait is mechanically superior—it clearly specifies the action cost, provides a balanced tactical option (disadvantage against other targets), and avoids forcing the DM to override Doom's tactics in potentially game-breaking ways, whereas S1's version that forces target selection is exploitable and inconsistent with 5e design conventions.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gpt: S1 is better balanced for CR 24 with more accurate damage output, follows standard 5e formatting more closely, includes appropriate lair actions for a villain known for elaborate bases, and offers cleaner playability—whereas S2's Doombot Contingency legendary action that removes Doom from the encounter entirely is mechanically problematic and potentially frustrating for players, and its multiattack (3 attacks + Frightful Presence + potential 5th-level spell replacement) produces offensive output exceeding CR 24.
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gemini: S2 follows proper 5e formatting with standard Lair Actions and Regional Effects appropriate for a major villain, uses cleaner action economy with bonus actions/reactions, and avoids S1's problematic Doombot Contingency which essentially negates encounters—while S2's lair-deployed Doombots achieve the same thematic goal without frustrating players.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: S2 better captures Doctor Doom's identity with the excellent Doombot Decoy mythic trait (representing his contingency plans), thematic ability names like 'Kneel Before Doom,' essential flight speed, Tactical Analysis representing his genius, and modern streamlined spellcasting—creating a more memorable boss encounter that fits both mechanically and thematically.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: S2 follows proper 5e conventions with standard spell slot progression (S1's at-will 1st/2nd level spells breaks bounded accuracy), includes essential thematic elements like Doombots, lair actions, and regional effects that make Doom feel complete, has brilliant character-driven abilities like 'Ego of Doom' referencing his Reed Richards obsession, and offers cleaner action economy with bonus actions for mobility and defense that improves playability.
- **gpt_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: S1 has better 5e formatting (no improper 'fly via spell' in speed line), cleaner thematic presentation with 'arcane blast' instead of confusing 'discordant spells' terminology, more spell variety (dominate person, telekinesis) appropriate for Doom's manipulative nature, and slightly better-balanced temp HP values for CR 23.

## Round 3

- **gpt_gemini_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_gpt: S1 has a more accurate CR 24 spell save DC (24 vs 21), better captures Doom's character through the brilliant 'Pride of Doom' exploitable weakness, and follows cleaner 5e formatting conventions, while S2's passive 20 temp HP regeneration creates grindy combat without the tactical depth of S1's player-interactive vulnerability.
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_claude: S1 provides a more complete Doctor Doom package with proper lair actions, regional effects, a dedicated Doombot statblock, cleaner 5e formatting, and superior thematic abilities like Power Absorption and Indomitable Will that better capture the character as an iconic boss encounter.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gemini: S1 has superior 5e formatting with a complete separate Doombot statblock for flexible use, better mechanical balance (incapacitated vs the overpowered stunned condition on Electroshock), appropriate DC 20 lair actions for CR 24, clearer Power Absorption wording with range requirements, and avoids S2's typo ('Is doing so').
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_claude: S2 is better balanced for CR 24 (S1's at-will 1st/2nd level spells and dual concentration is broken), includes properly formatted lair actions and regional effects befitting a legendary creature, and features the clever 'Pride of Doom' vulnerability that gives players tactical options while being thematically perfect for the character.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat gpt_claude_gemini: S1 is more complete with Regional Effects (standard for legendary creatures), clearer lair action context specifying where they apply, better-worded Containment Protocol using standard 5e area damage language, and the Force Field Surge properly addresses temp HP stacking—while the 20th-level spellcasting with feeblemind better represents Doom's supreme magical mastery.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat gemini_claude_claude: S2 is better balanced for CR 24 with appropriate HP (346), includes essential lair actions and regional effects that capture Doom as a sovereign ruler, uses cleaner 5e formatting with innate spellcasting for easier table play, and avoids S1's potentially overpowered dual concentration and guaranteed 30 temp HP/turn mechanics.
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: S1 better represents Doctor Doom with superior INT (28 vs 22) befitting Marvel's greatest genius, the iconic Indomitable Will trait, complete lair/regional effects essential for a domain-controlling villain, and more accurate CR 25 math through higher damage output and spell DC, while S2 feels underpowered for CR 23 and inexplicably lacks lair actions.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat gemini_gpt_gpt: S1 has cleaner 5e formatting (S2's '+22 Tinker's Tools' is mechanically incorrect), more tactically engaging design with the bonus action Tactical Analysis, better mythic actions that add meaningful new options like summoning Doombots, and properly uses spell attacks for INT-based ranged attacks whereas S2 inconsistently labels them as weapon attacks.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_claude: S1 is the superior statblock with complete 5e formatting including lair actions, regional effects, and a full Doombot statblock; better thematic representation with flight speed, ego weakness, and name-awareness; and while powerful, appropriately reflects Doom's Avengers-tier threat level, whereas S2 critically lacks a fly speed, has no lair actions for such an iconic lair-based villain, and uses awkward design choices like 'arcane blast functioning as eldritch blast.'
- **gpt_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: S1 maintains better mechanical balance with appropriate CR 23 numbers, while S2's dual concentration ability fundamentally breaks 5e design assumptions, has an inflated +17 attack bonus and DC 25 spell saves that exceed standard bounds, and the combination of mythic trait plus overpowered abilities makes it effectively much higher than its stated CR 24.
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: S2 follows standard 5e conventions with correct attack bonus calculations, proper spell slot usage (vs S1's non-standard at-will leveled spells), includes essential lair actions and regional effects befitting a CR 24 villain, and adds the thematic 'Pride of Doom' weakness that captures the character while improving playability and balance.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gemini_claude_gemini: S1 follows standard 5e formatting conventions better (lowercase damage types, proper expertise notation, tool proficiencies), is more accurately balanced for CR 24 with appropriate DCs (22-23 vs S2's overtuned DC 25), and includes better thematic features like detailed tool proficiencies and narrative-friendly Diplomatic Immunity, while S2's 1-action Arcane Blast legendary action is significantly overpowered compared to S1's balanced 2-action cost.
- **gpt_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: S1 follows 5e bounded accuracy conventions with reasonable DCs (20) and attack bonuses (+11/+12), proper slot-based spellcasting, and cleaner formatting, while S2 breaks 5e design with INT 30, DC 25 saves, +17 attacks, at-will 1st/2nd level spells, and overly complex reactions that circumvent standard spell mechanics.

## Round 4

- **gemini_gpt_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_gpt: S2 demonstrates better 5e formatting with consistent save DCs (lair DC matches creature DC), properly formatted Energy Blast damage using INT modifier, a complete self-contained Doombot statblock instead of referencing external stats, cleaner ability wording (Shield Protocol 3/Day, Electroshock targeting 'creatures of Doom's choice'), and the Command Construct legendary action that synergizes with the lair's Doombot deployment.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat claude_claude_gemini: S1 is better balanced for CR 24 (S2's 5th-level spells in multiattack and legendary actions is excessive), includes a complete Doombot statblock essential for play, and the Doombot Decoy reaction is a brilliantly thematic ability that captures Doom's signature tactic of using decoys.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gpt_claude_claude: S2 has cleaner mechanical language (explicit temp HP handling, Containment Protocol uses standard save-for-half, simpler Contingency that costs a slot), more correct 5e spell slot progression (1 8th-level slot vs S1's nonstandard 2), and better overall formatting, making it more playable and balanced.
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_gpt_gemini: S1 has better mechanical balance with properly limited reactions (Shield Protocol 3/Day vs unlimited), cleaner Electroshock timing ('until end of that creature's next turn' guarantees lost turn vs S2's awkward 'until end of Doom's next turn'), and more accurate CR 24 rating, while S2's unlimited reaction and spell-casting-as-multiattack features push it beyond stated CR 25 without acknowledgment.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat gpt_gpt_claude: S2 uses modern 5e (MotM-style) spellcasting for easier play, includes a perfectly thematic mythic Doombot Decoy trait representing Doom's contingencies, has built-in flight essential to the character, and features superior action economy with bonus actions and better-named abilities like 'Kneel Before Doom' that capture the villain's iconic presence.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat claude_gemini_gemini: S1 provides a properly formatted separate Doombot statblock (with CR, full stats, False Appearance, and Self-Destruct) that is far easier to run at the table, keeps the Decoy Protocol as Doom's own reaction for cleaner mechanics, maintains standard trait ordering, and avoids S2's typo ('Is doing so') and cramming Doombot rules awkwardly into a lair action.
- **gpt_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_claude: S1 is better balanced for its CR with standard 5e mechanics, while S2 has significant power creep issues—INT 30, dual concentration (breaking core 5e rules), DC 25 saves, at-will 1st/2nd level spells, 4 Legendary Resistances, and a mythic trait all stacked together push it far beyond CR 24 and would be frustrating to run and play against.
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gpt_claude_gemini: S1 better captures Doctor Doom's supreme threat level with appropriate CR 24 power (DC 24, fly speed, three-attack multiattack with spell integration), more interesting design choices like the 'Pride of Doom' weakness that creates tactical opportunities for players, superior lair actions with Doombot deployment, and more comprehensive regional effects befitting Marvel's most iconic villain.
- **gpt_gpt_gpt** beat gemini_claude_claude: S2 has more accurate CR calculations, better standard 5e formatting, and superior playability—its Doombot summoning adds tactical depth while S1's 'Doombot Contingency' legendary action is a frustrating narrative escape hatch that invalidates encounters, and S1's combination of 30 temp HP/turn, DC 25 saves, dual concentration, and free counterspells pushes it well beyond its stated CR 24.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: S1 has superior thematic representation (Doombot Contingency escape, 'Kneel Before Doom' ability, Frightful Presence), correct 5e formatting (S2 erroneously lists two 9th-level spells with only one slot), better CR 24 accuracy with appropriate offensive output, and more mechanically distinctive abilities befitting Doom's dual mastery of magic and technology.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_claude: S1 has superior CR-appropriate offense (+15 to hit, 3-attack multiattack), no mechanical errors (S2 incorrectly lists two 9th-level spells), better thematic naming ('Kneel Before Doom,' 'Doombot Contingency'), and a well-designed mythic phase that elevates it as a climactic boss encounter.
- **gpt_gemini_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: S1 is better balanced for its CR with more conservative but appropriate numbers, while S2's dual concentration ability, INT 30, and extremely high damage output (76+ per multiattack) push it well beyond CR 24 and break standard 5e design conventions.
- **gemini_claude_gemini** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: S2 is significantly more balanced with standard spell slots instead of S1's game-breaking at-will 1st/2nd level spells (infinite Shield/Misty Step/Hold Person), has cleaner 5e formatting with explicit initiative, and its Doombot Contingency as a narrative escape is more thematically appropriate to Doctor Doom's character than S1's mythic second-phase mechanic.

## Round 5

- **gemini_gemini_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gpt: S1 offers better mechanical synergy (Force Field recharging via Power Surge lair action), more appropriate lair save DCs for CR 24 (DC 23 vs 20), stronger legendary action economy (5th-level spells vs 3rd), the tactically useful Command Construct option, and a more appropriately powerful Doombot companion, while S2's thematic additions (Wounded Pride, Diplomatic Immunity) add flavor but introduce mechanical inconsistencies.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat claude_gpt_claude: S1's inclusion of the brilliant 'Pride of Doom' weakness adds crucial thematic depth and player agency, while its full wizard spellcasting with multiattack integration better represents Doom's mastery of sorcery; S2's blanket divination immunity is also less balanced than S1's 8th-level cap.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_claude: S1 provides superior 5e formatting with essential lair actions and regional effects that capture Doctor Doom's 'strongest in his domain' identity, while S2's Electro-Shock action is awkwardly structured, the initiative header is non-standard, and lacking lair actions significantly undercuts Doom's core thematic identity despite its clever Doombot Decoy mythic trait.
- **claude_gemini_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: S1 provides a more complete and thematically rich statblock with proper lair actions, regional effects, a full Doombot auxiliary statblock, and flavorful traits like Ego of Doom, while S2 has formatting issues (multiple 9th-level spells listed as prepared) and lacks the environmental/lair components expected of a CR 23+ legendary villain.
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gpt_claude_claude: S1 has correct 5e spell slot progression (S2 erroneously lists 2 8th-level slots), includes essential flight capability for Doom's armor, features higher Intelligence befitting Marvel's supreme genius, and the 'Pride of Doom' trait brilliantly captures his character flaw while maintaining strong thematic coherence.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gpt: S1 offers more complete 5e design with proper lair/regional effects befitting Doom's iconic stronghold, elegant weakness mechanics via Pride of Doom that create player agency, better CR 24 balance without broken abilities like dual concentration, and cleaner traditional formatting while both capture the character thematically.
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gpt_claude: S1 provides a more complete statblock with proper lair actions and regional effects, better thematic naming (Indomitable Will, Power Absorption), cleaner 5e formatting, and while both are powerful, S1's comprehensive design makes it more usable as a legendary villain despite being slightly overtuned, whereas S2 has formatting quirks like eldritch blast on a wizard and unusual 1/day notations within spell slots.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: S2 better captures Doctor Doom as a legendary threat with essential features like flight, the dramatically named 'Kneel Before Doom' ability, INT-based attacks befitting his genius, a mythic Doombot Contingency trait that reflects his famous backup plans, and a higher spell save DC (23) that properly represents his magical supremacy—all while maintaining solid 5e formatting and appropriate CR 24 balance.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: S1 provides a more complete and thematically rich representation of Doctor Doom with detailed lair/regional effects, the brilliant Reed Richards weakness, and better tactical depth appropriate for a CR 24 legendary villain, while S2's simpler design lacks the epic scope befitting the character.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gpt_claude_gemini: S1 better captures Doctor Doom's overwhelming power with its Mythic Trait creating a proper two-phase boss fight, higher sustained damage output (5 attacks per multiattack vs 2), thematic abilities like 'Kneel Before Doom' and 'Siphon Power,' and the dual concentration feature reflecting his techno-magical supremacy—though S2 has cleaner lair actions and Doombot summoning, its offensive output (~66 damage/round from attacks) falls significantly short for CR 24.
- **gemini_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_claude: S2 correctly calculates Gauntlet Strike damage using Intelligence (2d8+10=19) while S1 claims to use Intelligence but calculates with Strength (2d8+6=15), and S2 adds thematically appropriate features like Diplomatic Immunity and Investigation expertise that enhance Doom's identity as a tech-genius sovereign.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: S1 follows standard 5e spellcasting conventions with proper slot usage, while S2's at-will Hold Person and 2nd-level spells break balance guidelines; S1 also has more accurate CR calculation, consistent internal math, and better adherence to 5e formatting standards.
- **gpt_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gpt: S1 is more mechanically balanced for its CR, with appropriate damage output and standard 5e formatting, while S2's dual concentration, 166+ damage multiattack (8 Eldritch Blast beams plus Gauntlet Strike), and INT 30 significantly exceed CR 24 expectations and break bounded accuracy principles.

## Round 6

- **gemini_gemini_gpt** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_claude_gpt: S1 has superior 5e formatting, includes the essential fly speed that S2 inexplicably omits, provides a dedicated Doombot statblock rather than referencing helmed horrors, and offers more dynamic combat with its 3-attack multiattack and at-will tactical teleport while maintaining CR 24 accuracy.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat claude_gemini_claude: S1 has superior mechanical balance with properly limited abilities (Force Field on recharge, Power Absorption 3/day), a more functional Shield Protocol reaction, and the Pride of Doom trait offers clearer player counterplay with a defined DC, whereas S2's unlimited bonus action Force Field and unlimited Power Absorption reaction create balance concerns.
- **claude_gemini_gpt** beat claude_claude_claude: S1 is better balanced for CR 24 (limiting multiattack spell replacement to 3rd level vs S2's 5th), includes a complete Doombot statblock instead of requiring archmage modifications, uses incapacitated rather than the overpowered stunned condition on Electroshock, and adds superior thematic features like Diplomatic Immunity and the Doombot Decoy reaction that perfectly capture Doom's contingency planning.
- **claude_claude_gemini** beat claude_gpt_claude: S1's 'Pride of Doom' vulnerability is exceptional thematic design that captures Doom's defining weakness while giving players tactical agency, and its traditional wizard spellcasting better represents Doom as a learned sorcerer, though S2 has more appropriate lair action DCs (22 vs 18).
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_gpt_gemini: S2 employs modern 5e design conventions (simplified spellcasting, mythic trait structure) with superior playability, and its 'Doombot Decoy' mythic trait brilliantly captures Doom's signature trope of never knowing if you're fighting the real Doom, creating a more thematic and memorable encounter.
- **gemini_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gemini: S1 is better balanced for CR 24 with appropriate HP/AC, has correct spell slot formatting (S2 lists multiple 9th-level spells with only one slot), offers cleaner playability without overloaded bonus actions, and features thematic abilities like 'Kneel Before Doom' and the optional Doombot Contingency mythic trait without mechanically problematic features like S2's self-imposed disadvantage or empty traits.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat gpt_gemini_gpt: S2 is more balanced (Gauntlet Blast properly costs 2 legendary actions instead of 1), includes thematically essential lair actions and regional effects for Castle Doom, features a signature Contingency escape befitting Doom's preparedness, and follows 5e conventions for legendary creatures more completely.
- **gemini_claude_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_claude: S2 demonstrates better mechanical balance (standard spell slots instead of broken at-will casting, reasonable DCs of 22-23 vs excessive DC 25), superior thematic touches (Diplomatic Immunity trait, 'Doom Bolt' naming, stun immunity clause), cleaner 5e formatting (lowercase conditions, proper expertise notation), and improved playability with the elegantly designed Doombot legendary action that gives DM narrative control.
- **gpt_gpt_claude** beat gemini_claude_gemini: S2 has more accurate CR calculations, cleaner 5e formatting, better mechanical balance (DC 21 vs S1's excessive DC 25), and superior playability—S1's Doombot Contingency legendary action essentially invalidates the encounter entirely, while S2's Doombot features are thematic without being game-breaking.
- **gpt_gpt_gpt** beat gpt_gpt_gemini: S1's conditional Force Field Matrix (only triggers when temp HP is depleted) is more mechanically balanced and thematically sensible than S2's unconditional version, and S1 includes important details like the Doombot cap and plane shift for dimensional versatility, while S2's combination of higher stats, unconditional temp HP, and cheaper Force Field Surge (2 actions vs 3) pushes it beyond CR 23 balance.
- **gpt_gemini_claude** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: S1 maintains proper 5e mechanical integrity with accurate CR 23 balance, while S2 breaks fundamental rules (at-will Shield/Misty Step, dual concentration, DC 25 saves, ignoring resistances) that make it far more powerful than its CR 24 suggests and would be extremely difficult to run fairly.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: S2 demonstrates better 5e design with properly costed legendary actions (Gauntlet Blast at 2 actions vs 1 prevents action economy abuse), includes thematically essential lair actions befitting Doom's iconic fortress, adds a flavorful Contingency escape trait true to the character, and follows stricter formatting conventions like clarifying the 9th-level slot limitation.
- **gemini_claude_claude** beat gemini_gpt_gemini: S1 adheres to standard 5e spell slot progression while S2's at-will 1st and 2nd level spells (especially Hold Person) breaks bounded accuracy and 5e design conventions, creating oppressive and difficult-to-balance gameplay despite S2's more engaging mythic phase.

## Round 7

- **gemini_gpt_gemini** gets a bye (auto-win)
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_gemini: S1 has properly limited defensive abilities (Force Field on recharge, Shield Protocol 3/day) preventing abuse, includes a complete usable Doombot statblock instead of awkward inline archmage modifications, maintains consistent save DCs (23 throughout vs S2's mismatched 18 lair DCs), and features the thematic Command Construct legendary action.
- **claude_claude_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gpt: S1 demonstrates superior mechanical balance with appropriately limited abilities (Force Field on Recharge 5-6 vs unlimited in S2, 3/day Power Absorption), clearer rules without 'DM's discretion' ambiguity, and the Pride of Doom weakness elegantly gives players mechanical agency to exploit rather than relying on vague narrative triggers.
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat gemini_gpt_gpt: S1 provides a more complete boss encounter with essential lair actions and regional effects befitting Doom's role as ruler of Latveria, cleaner 5e formatting, easier playability, and thematically appropriate features like Summon Doombots and Contingency Protocol, while S2's missing lair effects and multiple overlapping recharge abilities create tracking issues despite its excellent Doombot Contingency mythic trait.
- **gemini_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_claude: S1 is better balanced for CR 24 (S2's AC 23, 367 HP, and full 20th-level spellcasting is overtuned), uses modern 5e innate casting format for easier tracking, has a brilliantly thematic mythic Doombot Decoy trait, and is significantly more playable at the table without sacrificing Doom's character identity.
- **claude_claude_claude** beat gemini_claude_gpt: S1 is more complete with proper lair actions, regional effects, and standard 5e formatting, while the brilliant 'Pride of Doom' flaw adds thematic depth; S2's 'Doombot Contingency' legendary action is mechanically problematic as it allows Doom to essentially escape defeat mid-combat, which undermines playability and could frustrate players.
- **gpt_claude_claude** beat claude_gpt_claude: S1 has more accurate CR tuning (DC 21 is appropriate for CR 24 while S2's DC 24 exceeds even CR 30 benchmarks), superior thematic elements like the Contingency escape and Latverian Loyalty regional effect, and uses traditional spell slot casting that better represents Doom's identity as a master sorcerer rather than innate magic.
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gpt_gpt: S1 better captures Doctor Doom's power with appropriate INT 28, built-in flight, superior action economy (3 attacks + spell), comprehensive lair actions/regional effects befitting a CR 25 villain, and two distinct reactions, while S2 inexplicably lacks flight speed, has lower INT, fewer multiattack options, and includes the warlock-exclusive eldritch blast on a wizard-type caster.
- **claude_gemini_gemini** beat gpt_gpt_claude: S2 follows modern 5e boss design conventions (bonus actions, spell replacement in multiattack, lair actions, regional effects) and provides a more complete encounter framework, while S1 has formatting errors mixing spell slots with '1/day' notations and lacks the environmental storytelling that makes Doom's lair iconic.
- **gpt_gemini_gpt** beat gpt_gemini_claude: S2 has cleaner 5e formatting with more precise rules language (e.g., explicit temp HP replacement clause, 'from an attack made by' wording), appropriately removes Spell Immunity from Doombots for better balance, and its AC 20 is more in line with CR 23 standards while the higher passive temp HP regeneration compensates effectively.
- **gemini_gemini_claude** beat gemini_claude_claude: S1's Mythic Trait handles the Doombot fantasy properly as a dramatic second-phase mechanic, while S2's Doombot Contingency legendary action awkwardly ends the encounter without resolution; additionally, S1's enhanced Siphon Power reaction and coherent mythic structure provide better playability despite the non-standard at-will spell formatting.
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat gemini_claude_gemini: S1 has more accurate CR 24 math (DC 21 vs S2's excessive DC 25, +13 attacks vs +17), better 5e formatting standards, and superior playability—S2's Doombot Contingency legendary action that retroactively negates the entire encounter is a problematic 'gotcha' mechanic that breaks standard 5e design, and dual concentration is severely unbalanced.
- **gpt_gpt_gemini** beat gpt_gemini_gemini: S1 is better balanced for CR 23—S2's doubled temp HP regeneration (30/turn), reaction that halves all damage, and 50 HP surge make its effective HP far too high for the stated CR, while S1's more restrained numbers, inclusion of Arcane Expertise, and cleaner material component clause provide better mechanical balance and thematic completeness.
- **gemini_gemini_gpt** beat gemini_gemini_gemini: S1 maintains proper 5e mechanical balance with standard spell slot tracking, while S2's at-will 1st and 2nd level spells (including Hold Person and Shield) is game-breaking and non-standard; S1 also has cleaner formatting with a dedicated Mythic Trait section, consistent INT-based attack modifiers, and better legendary action economy.
