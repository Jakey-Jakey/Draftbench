  "reasoning": "Top entries are the most DM-runnable while still feeling like Doom: gpt_claude is mechanically coherent (clean action economy, reasonable legendary actions, usable lair/doombots) with only mild CR drift; gemini_claude adds a strong cinematic mythic structure and good math, but has a few rules/clarity pain points (notably the concentration-breaking INT lair save and a confusing reaction trigger). gpt_gpt is solid and balanced but slightly less evocative and a bit conservative. The claude_* blocks nail theme/formatting and include excellent DM guidance, but trend toward oppressive defenses/control (e.g., frequent stun potential, heavy mitigation, counterplay-light battlefield lockdown) that can push practical CR above the label. gemini_gpt and gpt_gemini have notable 5e-standards issues (nonstandard skills, mismatched ability math, legendary action cost wording, overtuned multiattack/pulse details). The bottom two are significantly overtuned or structurally problematic for playability/CR accuracy (gemini_gemini’s near-full double-CR mythic reset + resource refresh and swingy summons; claude_gemini’s stacked passive damage reduction/crit negation + free high-level countering creating an unfun, low-counterplay slog)."
