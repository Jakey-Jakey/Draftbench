***Adaptive Force Field.*** When Doom rolls initiative, he gains 50 temporary hit points.

***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Doom uses Intelligence for attack and damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets and Electrified Touch (included in the attacks). These weapon attacks aren’t spells.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to psychic damage and the charmed condition, and he is unaffected by any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts unless he allows it. Divination spells can’t target Doom or perceive him through scrying sensors unless he allows it (as though Doom were under the effect of *mind blank*).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

* **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
* **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
* **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
* **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
* **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
* **5th level (3 slots):** *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
* **6th level (2 slots):** *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
* **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*
* **8th level (1 slot):** *power word stun*
* **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes two Arcane Gauntlets attacks.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombots (Recharge 6).*** Doom summons 1d3 Doombots (use **Helmed Horror** statistics, with Intelligence 18) to unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet of him. Each Doombot acts on Doom’s initiative count (immediately after Doom).  
When a Doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

---

## Reactions

***Power Siphon (Recharge 5–6).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom attempts to absorb and invert the magic. Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level without expending a spell slot. If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains hit points equal to 5 times the spell’s level.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

* **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
* **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlets attack.
* **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells.
* **Vector Trap (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a harmless pocket dimension until the end of Doom’s next turn. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
