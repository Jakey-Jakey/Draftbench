***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to the damage rolls of his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Expertise.*** Doom’s proficiency bonus is doubled for Arcana checks.

***Calculated Resilience.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against effects that would give him a level of exhaustion. He ignores the effects of 1 level of exhaustion.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Mind Blank (1/Day; Precast).*** Doom has *mind blank* active on himself at the start of combat (spell save DC 22). While it lasts, Doom is immune to psychic damage, can’t be charmed, and magic can’t read his thoughts, determine whether he is lying, or target him with divination magic unless he allows it.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
* 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
* 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
* 5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
* 6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
* 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift (self only)*
* 8th level (1 slot): *power word stun*
* 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets, or he makes one Arcane Gauntlets attack and one Electrified Touch attack.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on its saving throw or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombot (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons one Doombot in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of him (use **helmed horror** statistics, with Intelligence 18). The Doombot acts on Doom’s initiative (immediately after him). The Doombot can take only the Dodge action unless Doom commands it (see Command Doombot under Legendary Actions). Only one Doombot can be summoned this way at a time.

## Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell*, expending a spell slot as normal. If the spell is countered and it was 4th level or higher, Doom regains 10 + 5 × the spell’s level hit points.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

* **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
* **Command Doombot.** If Doom has a Doombot summoned, it can immediately take one action of Doom’s choice.
* **Gauntlet Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
* **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells (casting time 1 action), expending a spell slot as normal.
* **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space Doom can see within 60 feet and become restrained until the end of the target’s next turn.
