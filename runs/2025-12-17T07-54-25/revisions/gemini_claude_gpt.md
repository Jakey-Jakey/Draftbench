\*Doom has Expertise in Arcana and with tinker's tools.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 25 temporary hit points. If Doom takes damage that exceeds these temporary hit points, the excess is deducted from his regular hit points.

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom’s attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage. In addition, once per day, Doom can concentrate on two spells at the same time for 1 minute. If Doom’s concentration is broken during this time, both spells end.

***Mastermind’s Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to his initiative rolls (included).

***Universal Translator.*** Doom can speak and understand any language while wearing his battle suit.

***Diplomatic Immunity.*** As a sovereign ruler, Doom has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to demand safe passage, parley, or concessions when his identity is known. Attacking Doom in a public or politically sensitive context may carry consequences at the DM’s discretion.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks: one with his Gauntlet Strike and two with his Doom Bolt. He can replace one attack with casting a spell of 5th level or lower.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit (uses Intelligence), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (2d8 + 6 plus 4d8) bludgeoning and lightning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of Doom’s next turn. If a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to this stun effect for 24 hours.

***Doom Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d10 + 10) force damage.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing a wave of crushing gravity and psychic domination. Each creature within 60 feet of Doom must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (6d10 force plus 4d10 psychic) damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*  
- **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*  
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*  
- **5th level (3 slots):** *telekinesis, wall of force*  
- **6th level (2 slots):** *chain lightning, disintegrate*  
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*  
- **8th level (1 slot):** *power word stun*  
- **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*

## Reactions

***Siphon Power (3/Day).*** When Doom is targeted by a spell he can see (before its effects occur), Doom casts *counterspell* at 3rd level without expending a spell slot.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Relocation.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.

**Arcane Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Doom Bolt attack.

**Gadget or Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a prepared spell of 5th level or lower, or uses a magic item.

**Doombot Contingency (Costs 3 Actions).** This option can be used only while Doom has half his hit point maximum or fewer. Doom reveals that this body is a Doombot duplicate. The Doombot explodes, and each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The real Doctor Doom is not present; he cannot be encountered in person for 1d4 + 1 days. The Doombot leaves behind one genuine magic item, schematic, or crucial piece of plot information (DM’s choice).
