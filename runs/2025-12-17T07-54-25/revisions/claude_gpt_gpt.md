***Armor of Doom.*** Doom’s armor is a masterwork fusion of science and sorcery. While wearing it, Doom doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and he can survive in the vacuum of space. The armor can’t be removed against his will. If Doom would be moved against his will, he reduces the distance moved by up to 30 feet (to a minimum of 0 feet).

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically put him to sleep. Divination spells automatically fail if used to target or locate Doom unless he allows it.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*  
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield*  
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, misty step, scorching ray*  
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball*  
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility*  
5th level (3 slots): *dominate person, hold monster, wall of force*  
6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
7th level (2 slots): *finger of death, reverse gravity, teleport*  
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, feeblemind*  
9th level (1 slot): *power word kill, time stop*

___

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Energy Blast, or a combination of both. He can replace one attack with casting a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower, expending a spell slot as normal.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) lightning damage.

***Energy Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating blast from his armor. Each creature in a 90-foot cone must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

___

### Bonus Actions

***Force Field (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom activates his armor’s defensive systems, gaining 40 temporary hit points.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

___

### Reactions

***Power Absorption (1/Round).*** When Doom is subjected to a spell of 6th level or lower and succeeds on the saving throw against it, or when such a spell misses him with an attack roll, Doom absorbs a portion of the spell’s energy and regains one expended spell slot (maximum 4th level; minimum 1st level).

***Shield Protocol (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he gains a +5 bonus to AC against that attack (including the triggering attack), and he takes no damage from *magic missile*.

___

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check.

**Energy Blast.** Doom makes one Energy Blast attack.

**Command Construct.** One allied construct Doom can see within 60 feet of him can use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one attack.

**Electroshock (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 20 feet of him must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of the creature’s next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a prepared spell of 5th level or lower, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row. **Lair save DC 23.**

- **Automated Defenses.** Hidden weapons activate. Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

- **Lockdown.** Each creature of Doom’s choice within the lair must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by metal restraints until initiative count 20 of the next round. A restrained creature can use its action to attempt a Strength (Athletics) check against the lair save DC, freeing itself on a success.

- **Deploy Doombot.** A Doombot appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom and acts on initiative count 10. Doom can’t have more than one Doombot deployed at a time.

- **Power Surge.** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is concentrating on a spell must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration. Doom’s Force Field immediately recharges if it is expended.

___

## Regional Effects

The region within 6 miles of Doom’s primary lair is altered by his technology and magic:

- Doom is instantly aware when any creature speaks his name within this region.
- Doom can cast *scrying* at will (no components required) targeting any creature within 1 mile of his lair.
- Surveillance throughout the region makes it impossible to surprise Doom while he is in his lair, and he has advantage on initiative rolls there.

If Doom is destroyed, these effects end immediately, but the technological infrastructure remains functional for 1d10 days.
