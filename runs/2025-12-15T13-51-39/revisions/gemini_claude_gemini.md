***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Additionally, Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Contingency Protocol.*** When Doom is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he can use his reaction to cast *dimension door* without expending a spell slot, appearing adjacent to a prepared Doombot within 500 feet. This ability can't be used again for 24 hours.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to divination magic and effects that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or determine if he is lying. He is immune to any effect that would alter his mind.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
*   5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift*
*   8th level (1 slot): *power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons 1d4 **Doombots** (use **Helmed Horror** statistics with an Intelligence of 18) to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. The Doombots obey Doom’s verbal commands and take their turns immediately after his.

### Bonus Actions

***Emergency Teleport (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom casts *misty step* without expending a spell slot.

### Reactions

***Personal Force Field (Recharge 5–6).*** When Doom takes damage, he can use his reaction to halve the damage. If the damage is from a spell or magical effect, he can choose to be unaffected instead.

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell, Doom can attempt to absorb the magic. As a reaction, he casts *counterspell* (using a 3rd level slot unless he chooses to expend a higher one). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell countered.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells.
*   **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions; Recharge 5–6).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a prepared location within 1 mile (such as a dungeon cell or into a *forcecage*). A creature with more than half its hit points remaining has advantage on this save. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, returning to its original location on a success. If the destination is occupied, the spell fails.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Security Lockdown.** Steel barriers seal doorways. Each door requires a DC 25 Strength check to force open.
*   **Gas Release.** One 20-foot cube fills with knockout gas. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of their next turn.
*   **Doombot Deployment.** A **Doombot** emerges from a hidden alcove and takes its turn immediately.
