### Traits

**Arcane Power Armor.** Doom can’t be disarmed of his armor. His armor is an arcane focus for his spells. While wearing it, Doom ignores the somatic components of spells he casts.  
In addition, the **first** time Doom makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration each round, he has advantage on that save.

**Genius Tactician.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised while conscious.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Sovereign’s Presence.** While within 30 feet of Doom, creatures of Doom’s choice that can see or hear him have disadvantage on saving throws to avoid or end the **frightened** condition.

### Spellcasting
Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save **DC 21**, **+13** to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components for spells unless they have a listed gold cost or consume a component.

He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp  
- **1st level (4 slots):** absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** hold person, mirror image, misty step  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt  
- **4th level (3 slots):** banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility  
- **5th level (3 slots):** hold monster, synaptic static, telekinesis  
- **6th level (2 slots):** disintegrate, globe of invulnerability  
- **7th level (2 slots):** teleport, finger of death  
- **8th level (1 slot):** maze  
- **9th level (1 slot):** time stop  

> *Optional prebuff (if Doom has 1 minute to prepare):* Doom enters combat with **mind blank** active (no slot expended). If you use this, consider treating it as part of his “in-castle” advantage rather than default.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes three attacks: **two Repulsor Beams** and **one Armored Gauntlet**.

**Armored Gauntlet.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (1d10 + 6 plus 2d6) bludgeoning and lightning damage. This attack is magical.  
**Gravitic Impact (1/Turn).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone **or** pushed up to 10 feet (Doom’s choice).

**Repulsor Beam.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d10) force damage.

**War Magic.** Doom casts a spell of **3rd level or lower** (casting time 1 action) and makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.

**Technomystic Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom unleashes a hexed energy surge in a **60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line**. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature also **can’t take reactions** until the start of its next turn.

**Mystic Shackles (Recharge 6).** Doom targets **one creature** he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 27 (6d8) force damage and become **restrained** for 1 minute. A restrained creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
**Break the Shackles.** The shackles can also be destroyed: AC 19; 30 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic. If an adjacent creature uses an action to make a DC 21 Strength (Athletics) check or DC 21 Intelligence (Arcana) check, it can free the restrained creature, ending the effect.

---

### Reaction

**Arcane Countermeasures (3/Day).** When Doom is hit by an attack, fails a saving throw, or a creature he can see within 30 feet hits him with an attack, Doom uses one of the following countermeasures:
- **Deflecting Field.** Doom adds +5 to his AC against the triggering attack (potentially causing it to miss).
- **Stabilizing Runes.** Doom adds +4 to the triggering saving throw (after rolling, potentially turning it into a success).
- **Crackling Rebuke.** The triggering attacker must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage and **can’t take reactions** until the start of its next turn.

*(Doom still has only one reaction per round; this is meant to replace the “too many reaction buttons” issue while keeping his defensive feel.)*

---

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Cantrip.** Doom casts a cantrip.

**Gauntlet Strike.** Doom makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.

**Repulsor Shot (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one **Repulsor Beam** attack. On a hit, the beam deals 22 (4d10) force damage (instead of 5d10).

**Imperious Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet that can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to Doom’s Imperious Command for 24 hours.

---

## Optional: Lair Actions (Castle Doom)
When fighting inside his seat of power, Doom can invoke lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action below; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Seal the Chamber.** Arcane-metal doors and plates slam into place. Up to three openings Doom can see within 120 feet become sealed by reinforced barriers (AC 20; 80 hit points; damage threshold 10; immunity to poison and psychic).  
2. **Doombot Interdiction.** One **Doombot Enforcer** (see stat block below) appears in an unoccupied space Doom can see within 60 feet. The doombot acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order and lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed.  
3. **Null-Mystic Surge.** Each enemy of Doom’s choice within 120 feet that can cast at least one spell must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on concentration checks and **can’t cast spells as reactions** until initiative count 20 on the next round.

## Doombot Enforcer (Lair Minion)
*Medium construct, unaligned*

**Armor Class** 18 (plated alloy)  
**Hit Points** 60 (8d8 + 24)  
**Speed** 30 ft.

**Condition Immunities** poisoned  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10  
**Languages** understands Common but can’t speak  
**Challenge** 6 (2,300 XP) • **Proficiency Bonus** +3

**Actions**  
**Multiattack.** The doombot makes two **Plasma Bolt** attacks.  
**Plasma Bolt.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120/360 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) force damage.  
**Self-Destruct (1/Day).** The doombot explodes. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The doombot is destroyed.

---

### Optional Doom Twist (If You Want a Set-Piece Reveal)
**Doombot Deception.** The first time Doom would be reduced to 0 hit points, he instead drops to 1 hit point, and a hidden failsafe triggers: Doom becomes **invisible** until the end of his next turn and can immediately move up to his flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks. (This models “it was a doombot / misdirection” without adding a full second phase.)
