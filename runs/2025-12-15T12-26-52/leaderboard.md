## Judge Reasoning

### claude's Assessment
claude_claude leads with exceptional balance fixes (Shield 3/day, Arcane Supremacy 3/day, Servo-Guard cap), comprehensive DM guidance, party composition adjustments, and clean 5e formatting. gpt_gpt excels with streamlined design, excellent counterplay mechanics (Break the Shackles), and sensible AC 20. gpt_claude offers solid traditional spellcasting with smart Time Stop limitations. gemini_claude has proper mythic structure but Mind Transfer raises concerns. claude_gpt regresses by keeping Shield at-will and 90-ft cone. gpt_gemini is clean but Recharge on defensive reaction is unusual. gemini_gpt has good ideas but non-standard 'Technology' skill hurts formatting. gemini_gemini is overtuned with DC 26, +18 to hit, and 1d4 Helmed Horrors per lair action creating massive action economy issues. claude_gemini ranks last due to unlimited counterspell, -10 damage reduction stacking with crit immunity, and 77 damage Molecular Expulsion creating severe balance problems.

### gpt's Assessment
Top entries are the most DM-runnable while still feeling like Doom: gpt_claude is mechanically coherent (clean action economy, reasonable legendary actions, usable lair/doombots) with only mild CR drift; gemini_claude adds a strong cinematic mythic structure and good math, but has a few rules/clarity pain points (notably the concentration-breaking INT lair save and a confusing reaction trigger). gpt_gpt is solid and balanced but slightly less evocative and a bit conservative. The claude_* blocks nail theme/formatting and include excellent DM guidance, but trend toward oppressive defenses/control (e.g., frequent stun potential, heavy mitigation, counterplay-light battlefield lockdown) that can push practical CR above the label. gemini_gpt and gpt_gemini have notable 5e-standards issues (nonstandard skills, mismatched ability math, legendary action cost wording, overtuned multiattack/pulse details). The bottom two are significantly overtuned or structurally problematic for playability/CR accuracy (gemini_gemini’s near-full double-CR mythic reset + resource refresh and swingy summons; claude_gemini’s stacked passive damage reduction/crit negation + free high-level countering creating an unfun, low-counterplay slog).

### gemini's Assessment
gemini_gpt takes the top spot for its brilliant mechanical integration of Doom's lore: the 'Dual Concentration' with a specific Thunder vulnerability rewards player knowledge, and the Mythic 'Doombot Protocol' perfectly gamifies his signature trope without being cheap. claude_claude offers the best usability with superior formatting, tactical guides, and the narrative handling of the Doombot reveal, making it the most DM-friendly. The claude variants generically excelled in polish and balance. gemini_gemini was mathematically overtuned (DC 26, effectively 800+ HP), while gpt_gemini suffered from clunky mechanics like rolling for reaction recharge.
