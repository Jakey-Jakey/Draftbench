### Traits

**Doom Armor.** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. While wearing the armor, Doom can cast spells normally (including spells with somatic and material components), and his weapon attacks are magical.

**Force Field Matrix.** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he gains 20 temporary hit points. If Doom already has temporary hit points, he chooses whether to keep the ones he has or gain these. While Doom has temporary hit points, he has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Master of Magic and Machine.** When Doom casts a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or force damage, he can change that damage type to another type from that list.

**Mastermind’s Preparedness.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

**Contingency Protocol (1/Day).** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he can use his reaction to cast *plane shift* on himself (expending a 7th-level spell slot), transporting himself to a predetermined sanctum. He arrives there stable at 1 hit point.

**Spellcasting.** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). Doom requires no material components to cast his spells.

- **Cantrips (at will):** *eldritch blast, mage hand, mending, minor illusion, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp*  
- **1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, charm person, magic missile, shield*  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *hold person, invisibility, mirror image, misty step*  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly, lightning bolt*  
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility, stoneskin*  
- **5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force*  
- **6th level (2 slots):** *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*  
- **8th level (1 slot):** *maze*  
- **9th level (1 slot):** *meteor swarm, time stop* (Doom can cast either spell, but only has one 9th-level spell slot.)

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two attacks, using Doomfist or Gauntlet Blast in any combination.

**Doomfist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Gauntlet Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) force damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**Arcane Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom releases a surging wave of technomagical force in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons 1d4 + 1 constructs in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. Each summoned construct uses the **helmed horror** stat block, appears as a Doombot, and is under Doom’s control. The Doombots act on Doom’s initiative (immediately after his turn) and obey his telepathic commands. They vanish after 1 hour, when Doom is incapacitated, or when Doom dismisses them (no action).

---

### Reactions

**Redirective Shielding.** When Doom takes damage from a creature he can see within 60 feet, he reduces the damage by 25. If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can force the attacker to make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

---

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Cantrip.** Doom casts a cantrip.

**Warp Step.** Doom magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Gauntlet Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.

**Overclocked Casting (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower that has a casting time of 1 action.

**Force Field Surge (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom gains 40 temporary hit points. If he already has temporary hit points, he chooses which temporary hit points to keep.

---

### Lair Actions (Castle Doom)

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Security Override.** Doom targets one creature he can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage from concealed defense systems.

**Containment Protocol.** A 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of crackling force appears centered on a point Doom can see within 90 feet and lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature that enters the cylinder’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage (half on a success).

**Technomantic Disruption.** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on the next attack roll or ability check it makes before the end of its next turn.

### Regional Effects (Latverian Seat of Power)

The region containing Doom’s primary stronghold is warped by his sorcery and machines, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Scrying Interference.** Divination spells used to locate Doom or his stronghold have a 50 percent chance to fail, expending the spell.
- **Omnipresent Surveillance.** Tiny sensors and unseen servitors are ubiquitous. Creatures can’t gain the benefit of being hidden from Doom while within 1 mile of his stronghold unless they are protected from divination magic.
- **March of Steel.** Harmless maintenance constructs and patrol drones are common; hostile constructs appear unnaturally quickly in response to intruders.

If Doom dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
