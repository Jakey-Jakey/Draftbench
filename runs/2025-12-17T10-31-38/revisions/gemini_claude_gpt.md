***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he gains 30 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he is immune to the stunned condition.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components for his spells.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*  
- **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*  
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*

- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, teleport*  
- **8th level (1 slot):** *mind blank* (active)  
- **9th level (1 slot):** *time stop*  

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks using his Titanium Gauntlet or Gauntlet Blast, in any combination. He can replace one attack with casting a spell of 3rd level or lower.

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

## Reactions

***Power Siphon (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell of 5th level or lower, Doom can use his reaction to attempt to absorb its energy. The caster makes a spellcasting ability check contested by Doom’s Intelligence check (+18). If Doom wins, the spell fails and has no effect. Doom then regains one expended spell slot of a level equal to or less than half the absorbed spell’s level (minimum 1st level).

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Tactical Reposition.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells.

***Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).*** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational and psychic dominance. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, is knocked prone, and is restrained by crushing gravitational force until the end of Doom’s next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.
