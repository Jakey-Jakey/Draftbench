***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 30 temporary hit points. If Doom takes damage that exceeds these temporary hit points, the excess is deducted from his regular hit points.

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom's attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage. Additionally, Doom can maintain concentration on two spells at once. If he takes damage, he makes a single Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on both spells. The DC is 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher. If he fails the save, both spells end.

***Mastermind's Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to his initiative rolls.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses Frightful Presence. He then makes five attacks: one with Gauntlet Strike and four with Eldritch Blast. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) lightning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of Doom's next turn.

***Eldritch Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (1d10 + 10) force damage.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing a wave of gravity and psychic domination. Each creature within 60 feet of Doom must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
* 1st level (at will): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
* 2nd level (at will): *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
* 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
* 5th level (3 slots): *telekinesis, wall of force*
* 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate*
* 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift*
* 8th level (1 slot): *feeblemind*
* 9th level (1 slot): *meteor swarm*

### Reactions

***Siphon Power (Recharge 5–6).*** In response to seeing a creature within 60 feet cast a spell, Doom attempts to interrupt it. If the creature is casting a spell of 5th level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 6th level or higher, Doom makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect. If the spell is successfully countered, Doom targets the caster with an Eldritch Blast as part of this reaction.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Relocation.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.

**Arcane Blast.** Doom makes one Eldritch Blast attack.

**Gadget or Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower with a casting time of 1 action from his list, or uses an item.

### Mythic Trait

***Doombot Protocol.*** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, his current armor reveals itself as a construct and explodes. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The "real" Doom (or a fresh Doombot) teleports into an unoccupied space within 500 feet, regaining 200 hit points and resetting the recharge on Kneel Before Doom. Doom's spell slots and other features are not restored. Once this trait activates, Doom can't use it again for 1d4 days.
