  "reasoning": "gemini_gpt takes the top spot for its brilliant mechanical integration of Doom's lore: the 'Dual Concentration' with a specific Thunder vulnerability rewards player knowledge, and the Mythic 'Doombot Protocol' perfectly gamifies his signature trope without being cheap. claude_claude offers the best usability with superior formatting, tactical guides, and the narrative handling of the Doombot reveal, making it the most DM-friendly. The claude variants generically excelled in polish and balance. gemini_gemini was mathematically overtuned (DC 26, effectively 800+ HP), while gpt_gemini suffered from clunky mechanics like rolling for reaction recharge."
