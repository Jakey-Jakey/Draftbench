# gemini's Statblock (revised by gemini)

Here is the revised statblock for **Victor Von Doom**, updated to align with D&D 5th Edition design standards, balance requirements for Tier 4 play, and the specific feedback provided.

The most significant changes include converting **The Doombot Protocol** into a **Mythic Trait** (creating a frantic "Phase 2" boss fight), balancing the Action Economy regarding spellcasting, and refining the Reaction to be tactical rather than broken.

**Scientific Sorcery.** Doom’s armor and magic are intertwined. He acts as a spellcasting focus for all his spells. He ignores the verbal and somatic components of his spells, but his armor produces visible arcane glyphs when casting, allowing his spells to be perceived and targeted by *Counterspell*. Additionally, his spellcasting cannot be prevented by an *Antimagic Field* unless the field also suppresses technological items.

**Indomitable Ego.** Doom has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, as well as saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Mythic Trait: The Doom of Latveria.** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, his armor overloads and explodes. Each creature within 20 feet of him must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The body is revealed to be a **Doombot** chassis, which crumbles.
The true Victor Von Doom cloaking device deactivates, and he appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the explosion. He has 333 hit points, creates a fresh *Arcane Ward* on himself (50 temporary hit points), and immediately regains any expended uses of *Molecular Disruption* and *Legendary Resistance*.

***

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two Arcane Gauntlet attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting to cast an **At-Will** spell.

**Arcane Gauntlet.** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.

**Molecular Disruption (Recharge 5–6).** Doom emits a wave of destabilizing energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and is **Paralyzed** until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed.

**Spellcasting.** Doom casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (Spell Save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks):
*   **At will:** *Detect Magic, Mage Hand, Shield, Misty Step, Counterspell, Lightning Bolt (5th level)*
*   **3/day each:** *Wall of Force, Disintegrate, Telekinesis*
*   **1/day each:** *Power Word Stun, Plane Shift, Time Stop, Meteor Swarm*

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons 1d4 **Doombots** to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They share his initiative count but take their turns immediately after his.
*   **Doombot Statistics:** Use *Helmed Horror* statistics, but with a fly speed of 60 ft. They can make the following ranged attack: *Force Beam: +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (3d10) force damage.*

***

### Reactions

**Techno-Magical Siphon (Recharge 5–6).** When Doom is targeted by a spell or takes lightning or force damage, he can use his reaction to activate his armor's energy siphon. He takes no damage from the triggering effect and instead gains **Temporary Hit Points** equal to the damage preventing.

***

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Reposition.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom uses his gravitational generators to force obedience. Each enemy within 30 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone and become **Incapacitated** until the start of their next turn.

***

### Mythic Actions

If Doom's **The Doom of Latveria** trait has activated in the last hour, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

*   **Sorcerous Burst.** Doom casts a spell from his *At Will* list.
*   **Absolute Power (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom channels the Power Cosmic or raw magic. He recharges *Molecular Disruption* or regains a spell slot of 5th level or lower.

***

## Design Notes for the DM

*   **Counterspell:** While Doom ignores Somatic and Verbal components, the statblock specifies that his armor glows. This is a compromise to allow players to use *Counterspell* (which requires seeing a creature casting a spell). Without this, he effectively has "Subtle Spell" on everything, which creates a very "feel bad" experience for caster players.
*   **The Mythic Phase:** This monster is designed to be fought twice. Do not reveal the Mythic Trait until he hits 0 HP for the first time. The players should think they have won, only for the armor to explode and the "True Doom" to appear with refreshed HP. This justifies the "Campaign Ender" status.
*   **Tanking:** The change to the Reaction (*Techno-Magical Siphon*) from "Healing" to "Temp HP" prevents him from having infinite health against weak spell attacks, but still makes him incredibly durable against alpha strikes.
*   **Kneel Before Doom:** The Incapacitated condition prevents Actions and Reactions, effectively robbing the player of their turn, but avoids the rule confusion of "ending a turn" mid-cycle.
