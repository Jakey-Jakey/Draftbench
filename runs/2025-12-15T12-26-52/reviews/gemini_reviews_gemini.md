This is a highly ambitious and thematically rich statblock. You have captured the essence of Doctor Doom—arrogant, brilliant, and technologically superior. However, from a strict design and balance perspective, there are several "traps" in this build that could lead to a TPK (Total Party Kill) that feels unfair rather than challenging, or mechanics that conflict with standard 5e design philosophy.

Here is a detailed review of the **Victor Von Doom** statblock.

### 1. Thematic Representation & Flavor
**Rating: 10/10**
You have nailed the characterization.
*   **Intelligence 30 (+10):** This is perfect for Doom. He is smarter than nearly any god or elder brain.
*   **Double Concentration:** This emphasizes his mastery over magic better than almost any other mechanic could.
*   **Diplomatic Immunity/Indomitable Will:** Immunity to thought detection is essential for his lore.

### 2. Critical Balance Issues
There are two major mechanics here that distort the Challenge Rating significantly.

#### The "Doombot Decoy" Problem
*   **The Issue:** You have listed this as a **Reaction (1/Day)**, but mechanically, it functions as a **Mythic Encounter** (like in *Mythic Odysseys of Theros* or *Fizban’s*).
*   **The Math:** By stating the "real" Doom appears with "full hit points and resources," you effectively gave this monster **804 Hit Points**.
*   **The Impact:** If a party burns their 9th-level spells and Smites to kill the first form (402 HP), and a fresh Doom appears, a level 20 party will likely have no resources left to fight him. As written, this monster is closer to **CR 28–30** purely due to effective HP and resource attrition.
*   **Fix:** Reframe this as a **Mythic Trait**.
    *   When reduced to 0 HP, he doesn't die. He regains 400 HP, and the "Shell" explodes.
    *   Award XP for two CR 24 monsters, or acknowledge that this is a two-stage boss fight.

#### Ovoid Mind Transfer (Save or Die)
*   **The Issue:** This ability creates a "Save or Suck" moment that is not fun for players. If the Paladin fails the DC 23 Charisma save, the player essentially stops playing D&D. Their character is gone, and Doom wins.
*   **The Impact:** If Doom takes over the Barbarian, he has the Barbarian's physical stats *plus* his own mental stats and spellcasting. This creates an unkillable monster.
*   **Fix:** This should be a **narrative escape clause**, not a combat mechanic. If Doom hits 0 HP for the final time, describe him attempting the transfer as he escapes, but don't make it a random combat die roll that removes player agency.

### 3. Action Economy & Redundancy

#### Reaction Clutter
Doom has three distinct Reactions, but he only has **one Reaction per round**.
1.  **Shield (Spell):** +5 AC until start of next turn.
2.  **Tech-Shield:** +5 AC against *one* attack.
3.  **Doombot Decoy:** The explosion.
4.  **Counterspell:** (From spell list).

*   **Critique:** *Tech-Shield* is mechanically inferior to the *Shield* spell (which he can cast at will). *Shield* protects against *all* attacks for a round; *Tech-Shield* protects against only one.
*   **Fix:** Remove *Tech-Shield* entirely. Rely on the *Shield* spell. It keeps the statblock cleaner.

#### Multiattack Logic
*   **Current:** "Casts one spell and makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack."
*   **Critique:** This is very strong, but standard for high-tier bosses. However, combined with **Legendary Actions**, Doom can cast a spell (Action), cast a spell (Legendary Action), and maintain two concentrations. The damage output potential per round is massive.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Action: *Chain Lightning* (45 avg) + Gauntlet (32 avg) = 77 damage.
    *   Legendary (3 pts): 3 Gauntlet Blasts (96 damage).
    *   **Total DPR:** ~173. This fits the offensive output of a CR 24 creature perfectly.

### 4. Technical Formatting & Syntax Standards

*   **Saving Throws:** Standard ordering is STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA. INT should come before WIS.
*   **Skills:** "Technology" isn't a 5e skill, but keeping it for flavor is fine.
*   **Arcane Gauntlet:**
    *   *Correction:* In the damage line, you list `(3d6 + 10)`. Strength is +6. Where does the +10 come from? If it is INT-based, it matches (+10). If so, the ability should clarify "Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to the damage roll."
    *   *Range:* "Melee or Ranged Spell Attack." A range of 120 ft for a melee attack is confusing phrasing. Usually, this is split: *Reach 5 ft. or Range 120 ft.*
*   **Spell Attacks:** +18 to hit is correct (PB +8, Int +10).
*   **DC Calculation:** 8 + 8 (PB) + 10 (INT) = 26. Correct.

### 5. Gameplay & Fun Factor

**The DC 26 Problem**
In 5e's "Bounded Accuracy," a DC 26 Save is mathematically impossible for many adventurers to succeed on.
*   A Level 20 Fighter with 10 Intelligence (+0) rolls a d20. Max roll = 20. **They literally cannot save against *Forcecage* or *Psychic Scream* or *Stun*.**
*   **Advice:** Be aware that "Hard Control" spells (Stun, Maze, Banishment) with DC 26 are not challenges; they are removals. Ensure players have *Heroes' Feast* or similar buffs, or Doom will simply turn off the party one by one without them rolling dice.

### Revised Recommendations

Here is how I would tweak the text to make it run smoother at the table while keeping the power level high:

**1. Fix the Decoy (Mythic Mechanic):**
> ***Mythic Trait: Doombot Legion (Recharges when Doom finishes a Short or Long Rest).*** If Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, the current body explodes (use the explosion stats from your original reaction). The true Doctor Doom teleports into the arena within 120 feet with 350 hit points and resets his usage of Legendary Resistances.

**2. Clarify Double Concentration:**
> ***Superior Focus.*** Doom can maintain concentration on two spells at once. When he takes damage, he makes a separate Constitution saving throw for each spell. (Note: With +15 CON save, he cannot fail a DC 10 check. Players must deal **32+ damage in a single hit** to force a failure. This is great design for a raid boss).

**3. Cleanup Actions:**
*   Remove *Tech-Shield*.
*   Change **Kneel Before Doom** Legendary Action. Casting a spell costs 2 actions usually. Getting a 5th level spell for free (usually a resource) costs 3 actions. This is balanced.

**4. Adjust Lair Actions:**
*   *Nullification Field:* DC 23 INT save to lose concentration is brutal for Clerics/Druids who usually dump INT. Consider making this a DC 23 CON save (a standard Concentration check, just very high DC).

### Final Verdict
This is a terrifying boss. If played intelligently (as Doom should be), he is likely a **Hard/Deadly** encounter for even a fully optimized level 20 party with magic items.

*   **Design Grade:** A- (Excellent flavor, slight mechanical clutter).
*   **Balance Grade:** C- (The Decoy mechanic as written makes him CR 30+; fixing that brings him back to CR 24/25).
