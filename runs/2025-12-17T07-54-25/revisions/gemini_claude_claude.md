*\*Doom has expertise in Arcana.*

---

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 30 temporary hit points.

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom's attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage. Additionally, once per day, Doom can maintain concentration on two different spells at the same time for up to 1 minute. If he makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, the DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (whichever is higher) for each spell individually.

***Mastermind's Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to his initiative rolls (included in Initiative above).

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom uses his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks: one with his Gauntlet Strike and two with his Doom Bolt. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack (uses Intelligence):* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of Doom's next turn. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to the stun effect of Doom's Gauntlet Strike for 24 hours.

***Doom Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d10 + 10) force damage.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing a wave of gravity and psychic domination. Each creature within 60 feet of Doom must make a DC 25 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
- 5th level (3 slots): *telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift*
- 8th level (1 slot): *power word stun*
- 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Reactions

***Siphon Power (3/Day).*** When Doom is targeted by a spell, he can use his reaction to cast *counterspell* at 3rd level without expending a spell slot.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Relocation.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.

**Arcane Blast.** Doom makes one Doom Bolt attack.

**Gadget or Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list, or uses an item.

**Doombot Contingency (Costs 3 Actions).** When Doom has been reduced to half his hit point maximum or fewer, he can reveal that his current form was a Doombot construct. The Doombot explodes, dealing 35 (10d6) fire damage to all creatures within 20 feet (DC 25 Dexterity saving throw for half). The real Doctor Doom is not present—this encounter was a test or diversion. The Doombot leaves behind one genuine magic item or piece of plot information at the GM's discretion. Doom cannot be encountered in person for 1d4+1 days, during which he prepares his actual response to the party. *(This ability should be telegraphed to players through earlier investigation or NPC warnings that "one can never be certain they face the true Doom.")*
