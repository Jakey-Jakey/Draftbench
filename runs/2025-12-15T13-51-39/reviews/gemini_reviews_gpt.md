This is a very strong draft for a high-tier "Boss Monster." You have successfully captured the feel of Doctor Doom—an arrogant, nigh-indestructible fusion of technology and sorcery. He feels tanky, intelligent, and dangerous.

However, for a **CR 22** creature intended to challenge Tier 4 highly-optimized parties, there are some mathematical discrepancies, action economy inefficiencies, and minor formatting issues to address.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the statblock.

### 1. Formatting and Math Check
There are a few numbers that don't add up based on the ability scores provided.

*   **Doomfist Strike Math:**
    *   **Current:** `+11 to hit, 13 (2d6 + 6)`
    *   **The Issue:** His Strength is 18 (+4). The +11 to hit represents STR (+4) + Proficiency (+7). This is correct. However, the damage lists `+6`. In 5e, usage of the same stat (STR) usually applies to both.
    *   **Fix:** If the gauntlets are "magical" providing a +2 bonus, the To Hit should be **+13** and the damage **+6**. If they are not +2 weapons, the damage should be **+4**. I recommend increasing the To Hit to +13 to match the spell attack, reflecting his technological enhancement.
*   **XP Value:** CR 22 is typically **41,000 XP**, so this is correct.
*   **Skill Math:**
    *   Arcana/History/Investigation: INT (+6) + Prof (+7) = +13. **Correct.**
    *   Insight/Perception: WIS (+3) + Prof (+7) = +10. **Correct.**
    *   Intimidation: CHA (+5) + Prof (+7) = +12. **Correct.**

### 2. Action Economy & Balance
At CR 22, action economy is king. Doom has some potential bottlenecks here.

*   **Tactical Teleport (The Biggest Issue):**
    *   Currently, this is listed as an **Action**.
    *   **Analysis:** If Doom spends his turn teleporting 30 feet, he isn't attacking or casting spells. A standard Wizard can *Misty Step* (Bonus Action) and still fire off a cantrip/attack. For a CR 22 boss, movement abilities should almost never consume the main Action unless they deal damage (like a teleport slam).
    *   **Fix:** Move **Tactical Teleport** to a **Bonus Action** or make it a **Legendary Action (Costs 1)**.

*   **Legendary Action Costs (Arcane Gauntlet):**
    *   **Current:** *Arcane Gauntlet (Costs 2 Actions)*
    *   **Analysis:** This deals 27 average damage. *Doomfist* deals 23 average damage and costs 1 Action. This incentivizes Doom to brawl in melee rather than stay at range, which feels counter-intuitive for a super-genius wizard.
    *   **Fix:** Reduce the cost of **Arcane Gauntlet to 1 Action**. This allows him to spread damage across the battlefield and feels more oppressive. Alternatively, keep it at 2 Actions but significantly boost the damage/effect (e.g., target is stunned or restrained).

*   **Concentration Bottleneck:**
    *   Doom has *Hold Person, Greater Invisibility, Stoneskin, Dominate Person, Telekinesis, Wall of Force, Globe of Invulnerability, Forcecage, Dominate Monster, Time Stop*.
    *   Almost all his best spells require Concentration. While accurate to 5e rules, it limits a solo boss.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add a feature or item trait (perhaps his mask) that allows him to maintain concentration on two spells at once, or gives him non-concentration versions of effects (like a permanent *Stoneskin* effect built into the armor).

### 3. Thematic and Design Critique

*   **Spell Turning:** This is a classic D&D monster ability (Rakshasa/Crag Cat), but the wording "targets only him (not an area)" can lead to rules arguments at the table regarding spells like *Ice Knife* or *Green-Flame Blade*.
    *   **Refinement:** Use the standard wording found in the **Androsphinx** or **Spectator**: *"If the spell forces a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell is an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature."* Your current wording is close, just ensure it covers the mechanics clearly.

*   **Counterspell Protocol:**
    *   This is a great design choice (Trait rather than just a spell slot). However, it consumes his **Reaction**.
    *   **The Problem:** Doom has *Shield* and *Absorb Elements* prepared. If he uses *Counterspell Protocol*, he cannot cast *Shield* that round. A generic Fighter with Great Weapon Master will chew through AC 21 quickly at level 20.
    *   **Fix:** Consider adding: *"Doom can take one reaction on every turn in a combat"* (like a Marilith), OR change his armor trait to apply the *Shield* spell effect automatically x/times per day without a reaction.

*   **The "Doombot" Factor:**
    *   The statblock lacks the one thing Doom is most famous for meant: It was never actually him.
    *   **Suggestion:** Add a **Reaction** or a **Mythic Trait** (if you want a Phase 2) called **"Doombot Decoy."**
    *   *Effect:* When reduced to 0 HP, reveal the body was a construct, it explodes for force damage, and the real Doom enters initiative or was actually the one standing 30 feet away invisible.

### 4. Constructive Edit Proposals

Here are specific changes to copy-paste into your statblock to polish it to official WotC output standards:

**Adjusted Actions Section:**
> ***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* **+13** to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. (Adjusted attack bonus to reflect "tech/magic" accuracy boosting, normalized strength damage).

> ***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** (Keep as is).

> ***Tactical Teleport.*** (Move this to **Bonus Actions**).

**Adjusted Legendary Actions Section:**
> ***Arcane Gauntlet.*** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet Blast attack. (Removed "Costs 2 Actions").

> ***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from his list of prepared spells. (Reduced cost from 3 to 2 to make him more dynamic, or keep at 3 but allow up to 5th level spells).

### 5. Final Verdict: CR Assessment
*   **calculated Defensive CR:** 24 (High AC + Saves + Immunities + Magic Resistance + Legendary Resistance).
*   **calculated Offensive CR:** 20 (His DPR is roughly 120 per round without expending high-level slots, but he has high DCs and devastating crowd control).
*   **Total CR:** 22 looks accurate.

**Summary of Recommendations:**
1.  **Move "Tactical Teleport"** to Bonus Actions.
2.  **Fix melee math** (+13 to hit / +6 dmg).
3.  **Reduce Legendary Action cost** for Arcane Gauntlet to 1.
4.  **Clarify Counterspell Protocol** usage vs. the *Shield* spell (Reaction economy).
5.  **Add "Technological Superiority"** (optional): Consider giving him proficiency in CON saves (he has +7, but at CR 22, players will have DC 19-21 saves. +7 might fail concentration often).

This is a fantastic boss block that will likely TPK an unprepared party. Good job
