___

***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor grants the following benefits: his AC equals 18 + his Dexterity modifier, he can breathe in any environment (including vacuum), and he is immune to disease.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to effects that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts. Additionally, when a creature attempts to charm or frighten Doom, or attempts to read his mind, the creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Master of Magic.*** Doom casts *counterspell* and *shield* at 3rd level without expending a spell slot (see Reactions).

***Mythic Trait: Doombot Revelation (1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he does not die or fall unconscious. Instead, he reveals the damage was sustained by a robotic shell. He regains 150 hit points, resets the recharge of his Doom Blast, and immediately summons one **Doombot** to an unoccupied space within 30 feet.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

At will: *detect magic, mage hand, prestidigitation*
3/day each: *dimension door, dispel magic, lightning bolt, mirror image, misty step*
1/day each: *banishment, forcecage, globe of invulnerability, power word stun, telekinesis, wall of force*

***Supreme Intellect.*** As a bonus action, Doom analyzes one creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the end of Doom's next turn, he has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Doom's spells and abilities.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) electric damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d8 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of arcane devastation. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 55 (10d10) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack, he creates a momentary barrier, adding +5 to his AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.

***Cast a Spell.*** Doom casts *counterspell* or *shield* using his Master of Magic trait or an available spell slot.

***Retributive Strike (Recharge 6).*** When a creature within 60 feet damages Doom, he forces it to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactics.** Doom uses Tactical Repositioning or Supreme Intellect.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower, expending a slot or use.
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 27 (6d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Mythic Actions

If Doom's Mythic Trait is active, he can use the options below as legendary actions for 1 hour after using Doombot Revelation.

**Coordination.** Doom commands a Doombot to make one attack as a reaction.
**Arcane Overdrive (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom recharges his Doom Blast.

## LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action while in Castle Doom to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row. The save DC for these effects is 22.

- **Activate Defense Turrets.** Two arcane turrets emerge from the walls. Up to two creatures Doom can see within 120 feet must each make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failure, or half on a success.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors and passages seal shut (AC 20, 50 HP, immune to poison and psychic damage). Doom can open any sealed door at will.
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point within 120 feet. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.
- **Summon Reinforcements.** One **Doombot** emerges from a hidden alcove within 60 feet of Doom. Doom can have no more than two Doombots summoned by this lair action at a time.
