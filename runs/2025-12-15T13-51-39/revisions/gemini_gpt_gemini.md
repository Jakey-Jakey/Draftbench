***Arcane Technology.*** Doom’s armor serves as an arcane focus. Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to damage rolls with his Arcane Gauntlets (included in the attack).

***Expertise.*** Doom adds double his proficiency bonus to Arcana checks (included above).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Blank.*** Doom is under the effect of a *mind blank* spell. He is immune to psychic damage, to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts, and to divination spells.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

*   Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation*
*   1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, thunderwave*
*   2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, misty step, scorching ray*
*   3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*
*   4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, locate creature*
*   5th level (3 slots): *modify memory, telekinesis, wall of force*
*   6th level (2 slots): *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
*   7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, reverse gravity*
*   8th level (1 slot): *power word stun*
*   9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Arcane Gauntlets. He can substitute one of these attacks with an Electrified Touch.

***Arcane Gauntlets.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Electrified Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) lightning damage, and the target cannot take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Doom's choice that is within 120 feet of Doom and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Summon Doombot (1/Day).*** Doom magically summons a Doombot to an unoccupied space within 60 feet. The Doombot uses the statistics of a **Helmed Horror**, but it has an Intelligence of 18 and speaks Latverian. The Doombot acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order and obeys his verbal commands (no action required). Only one Doombot can be active at a time.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon.*** When a creature within 60 feet of Doom casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* (using a 3rd level spell slot, or a higher slot if he chooses). If the spell is successfully countered, Doom’s armor absorbs the residual energy, healing him for 20 hit points.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Movement.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one attack with his Arcane Gauntlets.
*   **Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 1st through 3rd level from his prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.
*   **Vector Trap (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a pocket dimension prison prepared by Doom. While there, the target is incapacitated. The target remains there for 1 minute or until it succeeds on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, reappearing in the space it left or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
