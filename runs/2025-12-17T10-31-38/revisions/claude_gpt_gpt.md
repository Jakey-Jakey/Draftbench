___

***Doom Armor.*** While wearing his armor, Doom’s AC is **13 + his Intelligence modifier** (included in his AC). He can breathe in any environment (including vacuum), is immune to disease, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will.

***Doombot Contingency (1/Day; Optional).*** If the DM chooses, the Doom encountered may be a Doombot decoy. A creature within 10 feet of Doom can use an action to make a DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check, learning whether Doom is a decoy on a success.  
If Doom is a decoy, when he is reduced to 0 hit points, the decoy is destroyed and the true Doom appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet with **169 hit points**. Doom’s expended resources (such as limited-use traits and spells) don’t refresh.

***Indomitable Will.*** Once per turn, when a creature Doom can see attempts to charm or frighten Doom, or targets Doom with an effect that would read or control his mind, that creature takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts spells using Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components to cast his spells.
- **At will:** *detect magic, fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation*
- **3/day each:** *absorb elements, banishment, counterspell, dispel magic, dimension door, fireball, greater invisibility, hold monster, lightning bolt, misty step, wall of force*
- **1/day each:** *chain lightning, disintegrate, forcecage, globe of invulnerability, dominate monster, plane shift, teleport, time stop, power word stun, power word kill*

***Supreme Intellect.*** Once per round, Doom can use a bonus action to analyze one creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the end of Doom’s next turn, Doom has advantage on attack rolls against the target, and the first time the target makes a saving throw against Doom’s spells or abilities during that duration, it does so with disadvantage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) force damage.

***Arcane Magnetic Wave (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom releases a crushing surge in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 54 (12d8) force damage, is pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

***Summon Doombot (Recharge 6).*** Doom summons one **Doombot** in an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet. The doombot acts on Doom’s initiative and obeys his commands. Doom can have no more than **two** doombots summoned by this trait at a time; if he summons a third, one existing summoned doombot (Doom’s choice) is destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Doom Barrier (3/Day).*** Doom gains 40 temporary hit points.

***Tactical Repositioning.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Force Field (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack he can see, or when he fails a saving throw against an effect he can see, Doom adds +5 to his AC against that attack or +5 to that saving throw, potentially causing the attack to miss or the save to succeed.

***Retributive Strike (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet hits Doom with an attack, Doom forces that creature to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Analyze.** Doom uses Supreme Intellect.  
**Teleport.** Doom uses Tactical Repositioning.  
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.  
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 4th level or lower from Spellcasting, expending the spell’s normal use.  
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn. A successful save halves the damage and prevents the stun.

---

## LAIR ACTIONS (CASTLE DOOM)
On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombots.** One **Doombot** emerges from a hidden alcove in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Doom. If this would cause more than two doombots allied with Doom to be present that originated from Doom’s effects or the lair, Doom chooses one such doombot to be destroyed.  
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see within 120 feet must each make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Lockdown Protocol.** Doors, passages, and portcullises in the lair seal shut. A sealed barrier has AC 18, 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. Doom can open any sealed barrier at will (no action).  
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point within 120 feet of Doom. Creatures of Doom’s choice in the area must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.

___

***False Appearance.*** While motionless, the doombot is indistinguishable from a humanoid in Doom-like armor. A creature that can see the doombot can use an action to make a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check, discerning its true nature on a success.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The doombot’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
- **3/day each:** *magic missile* (3rd level)

***Self-Destruct.*** When the doombot is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The doombot makes two Gauntlet Strike attacks.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (4d6 + 2) force damage.

### Reactions

***Shield (3/Day).*** When the doombot is hit by an attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell, it casts *shield*, potentially causing the attack to miss.
