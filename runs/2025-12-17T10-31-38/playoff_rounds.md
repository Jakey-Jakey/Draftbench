## Matches

- **claude_claude_gpt** beat claude_claude_claude (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 has cleaner mechanical design with proper limitations (Supreme Intellect cooldown, explicit Doombot cap in all relevant abilities), while S2 has a confusing Doom Armor description claiming AC includes INT modifier without clarity on whether the listed AC already incorporates it, creating potential calculation issues.*
  - GPT: *S1 is more mechanically balanced and playable due to tighter caps/limitations (notably Supreme Intellect’s 1-minute lockout and Doombot summon maximum), clearer armor/contingency wording, and fewer confusing or CR-inflating omissions than S2.*
- claude_gemini_gpt vs claude_gpt_gemini: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gemini_gpt: *S1 better represents CR 25 with appropriate HP/damage, features a more thematic and dramatic mythic trait (Doombot Protocol with LR reset and explosion), includes signature Doom spells like time stop and power word kill, and has cleaner 5e formatting with a more versatile reaction system.*
  - GPT picked claude_gpt_gemini: *S2 is closer to a playable, CR-25-appropriate boss with bounded defenses (limited reactions and a more reasonable mythic HP swing), cleaner 5e mechanics, and fewer encounter-warping elements than S1’s effectively CR-above-25 durability and near-unlimited +5 defensive reaction.*
- claude_gemini_gpt vs gpt_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gemini_gpt: *S1 better captures Doctor Doom thematically with the iconic Doombot Protocol mythic trait, Supreme Intellect analysis feature, and Indomitable Will, while also including a complete Doombot statblock; it has more varied legendary actions and higher INT (28) befitting Marvel's greatest genius, with properly formatted 5e presentation throughout.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gpt: *S2 is closer to CR 25 expectations with more reasonable DCs/attack bonuses and effective durability, cleaner 5e-style action economy (including mythic/legendary options) and clearer play at the table, while S1’s extremely high DCs, stacked defenses, and effective 750+ HP with swingy save penalties push it beyond the stated CR and reduce playability.*
- claude_gpt_claude vs gpt_claude_gemini: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gpt_claude: *S2 excels with the brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' flaw mechanic that captures Doom's character while creating meaningful tactical trade-offs, includes a complete Doombot statblock for dramatically improved playability, and has cleaner 5e formatting—whereas S1 has minor inconsistencies like referencing cantrips not in its spellcasting list and a situationally-limited Master of Machines ability.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gemini: *S1 stays closer to 5e’s bounded-accuracy expectations (DC/bonuses, resources, and action economy) while still feeling like Doom via technomancy/mythic/lair tools, whereas S2’s DC 25 + Supreme Intellect/save-lock spells and extra minion pressure push it past a believable CR 25 and reduce playability.*
- claude_claude_claude vs gpt_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_claude_claude: *S1 better captures Doctor Doom's identity with full wizard spellcasting reflecting his arcane mastery, the iconic Doombot Contingency mechanic, comprehensive lair/regional effects, and includes the complete Doombot statblock, while maintaining proper 5e formatting and offering richer tactical options despite slightly higher-than-standard DCs.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gpt: *S2 is better balanced and more runnable at the table with CR-appropriate DCs/bonuses and streamlined spell/feature load, whereas S1’s extremely high DC 25/+17 math plus stacked defenses (all-damage resistance, multiple rerolls, and a Doombot extra-life) likely overshoots CR 25 and is overly complex to adjudicate.*
- **claude_gpt_gemini** beat claude_claude_claude (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 is better balanced for CR 25 with cleaner 5e formatting (modern X/day spellcasting), while S2 has problematic unlimited Retributive Strike reactions, an overpowered Energy Shield bonus action granting resistance to ALL damage, and confusing AC math in the Doom Armor description that doesn't align with the listed AC value.*
  - GPT: *S1 is better balanced and more CR-appropriate while staying thematically “Doom” and being far more playable/cleanly formatted, whereas S2’s overloaded full wizard list plus all-damage resistance, PWK/time stop access, and ambiguous armor text make it swingier, slower to run, and easier to overtune past CR 25.*
- claude_claude_gpt vs claude_gemini_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gemini_gpt: *S1 follows modern 5e monster design with streamlined spellcasting, a more dramatic and mechanically impactful mythic trait (full HP restoration + legendary resistance refresh), cleaner action economy, and better playability without sacrificing depth, while S2's traditional spell slot system and multiple tracking requirements (bonus actions, two reactions, spell slots, cooldown timers) make it significantly harder to run at the table.*
  - GPT picked claude_claude_gpt: *S2 is closer to a true CR 25 in both durability and damage while using clearer 5e resource structures (slots/limited uses) and tighter action economy, making it more playable and less overtuned than S1’s mythic extra life, stronger save-manipulation, and higher burst/Doombot spikes.*
- claude_gpt_gpt vs gpt_claude_gemini: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gpt_gpt: *S1 better captures Doctor Doom's iconic elements with included Doombot statblock, the clever Doombot Contingency decoy mechanic, Indomitable Will reflecting his legendary willpower, and a more comprehensive blend of technology and sorcery; S2's mythic trait is interesting but lacks Doombots entirely and includes thematically questionable features like telepathy and the situational Master of Machines ability.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gemini: *S2 is closer to official 5e monster design with more reasonable save DCs/bonuses and clearer action economy (plus a properly framed mythic phase), whereas S1’s extremely high DC 25/Int 28 tuning, stacked survivability (temp HP, contingency second body), and overwhelming spell suite push it well past a believable CR 25 and make it harder to run.*
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_claude (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 demonstrates better mechanical balance with limited-use Retributive Strike (3/day vs unlimited), capped Doombot summoning (max 2), consistent DC scaling for lair actions (DC 25 vs S1's DC 18 which is too low for CR 25), modern innate spellcasting format that's easier to run, and a more tactically interesting Doombot with Shield reaction.*
  - GPT: *S2 is more mechanically balanced and CR-consistent (less runaway durability/minion spam, clearer Doombot contingency, consistent DCs), uses cleaner 5e-friendly spell/trait formatting, and is easier to run at the table while still feeling like Doctor Doom.*
- claude_gpt_claude vs gpt_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gpt_claude: *S1 captures Doctor Doom's character far better with the brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' mechanical flaw, includes essential Doombot statblocks, has appropriate CR 25 DCs (25 vs S2's 22), and offers Superior Intellect which is universally useful—whereas S2's Master of Machines is nearly useless outside construct-heavy encounters, and S2 entirely omits Doombots which are iconic to the character.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gpt: *S2 is closer to DMG CR 25 benchmarks (attack bonus/save DC), uses cleaner 5e formatting, and is more runnable at the table without S1’s inflated DC/bonuses and extra subsystem-like wrinkles, while still conveying Doom’s technomystic theme.*
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_gemini_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 is better balanced for CR 25 with more appropriate HP/damage values, features brilliant design with the 'Arrogant Monologue' trait that adds thematic flavor while providing built-in counterplay, follows modern 5e design conventions with bonus actions, and includes better-designed Doombots with detection rules and meaningful reactions.*
  - GPT: *S2 is closer to a playable, CR-25-appropriate boss (more bounded defenses with limited-use reactions/temps and less oppressive always-on mitigation), while S1’s extremely high effective HP plus broad resistances and essentially unlimited defensive reaction/legendary resistance loops push it well beyond its stated CR and make the fight swingy and frustrating.*
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_claude_claude (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 uses proper 5e Mythic Trait formatting instead of the awkward Doombot Contingency, includes the brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' weakness that mechanically enforces Doom's character flaw while providing balance, has limited uses on Retributive Strike for better resource management, and employs modern streamlined spellcasting that's easier to run while maintaining threat level.*
  - GPT: *S2 is more mechanically balanced and playable for CR 25 by streamlining Doom’s spellcasting, bounding key defenses/reactions, and using an official-style mythic phase for accurate encounter pacing, whereas S1 is overstuffed and overtuned (notably broad resistances, unbounded Retributive Strike, and an extra-life contingency that effectively inflates CR).*
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_gpt_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 features a properly implemented mythic trait for two-phase boss design, and the 'Arrogant Monologue' trait is brilliant thematic design that creates a meaningful weakness reflecting Doom's ego while balancing his power—something S2 lacks entirely despite having slightly better damage resistances and a more varied spell list.*
  - GPT: *S1 is thematically richer and more cohesive (mythic phase, Doom-centric gadgets, doombots, and lair play), with a tighter, more playable kit and fewer swingy/bloated elements (e.g., S2’s power word kill and oversized spell list/odd CR bump) that risk pushing it past CR 25 balance.*
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_claude_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 uses modern 5e design conventions (simplified at-will/per-day spellcasting), has better mechanical balance (usage-limited Retributive Strike, controlled Doombot summoning with max 2), consistent high-CR lair action DCs (25 vs S1's 18), and is significantly easier to run at the table while maintaining tactical depth.*
  - GPT: *S2 is closer to a playable, CR-appropriate solo boss (capped doombot economy, less oppressive defenses, and lair DCs that match his tier) while keeping Doom’s theme, whereas S1 is overtuned and can bog play down with excessive durability, unlimited retributive damage, and mass summons.*
- **claude_gpt_claude** beat claude_claude_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 uses modern 5e design conventions (innate spellcasting, mythic trait) that are cleaner and more playable, includes the thematically brilliant 'Arrogant Monologue' weakness that perfectly captures Doom's character, has appropriately scaled lair action DCs (22 vs S1's too-low 18), and the mythic trait provides a clearer 'second phase' mechanic than S1's confusing Doombot Contingency.*
  - GPT: *S2 is generally more mechanically balanced and easier to run at the table (tighter resistances, limited reaction damage, streamlined spellcasting, and a clear mythic-phase structure), whereas S1’s stacked defenses and effectively spammable punishment reactions make its claimed CR 25 and encounter pacing less reliable despite strong theming and formatting.*
- gpt_claude_gemini vs claude_gemini_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gemini_gpt: *S1 captures Doctor Doom's essence far better with the iconic Doombot Protocol mythic trait, Supreme Intellect analysis ability, and appropriate high-level spells like Power Word Kill and Dominate Monster, while S2 borrows too much Iron Man terminology (Unibeam, Repulsor) and lacks the thematic Doombot mechanics that define the character.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gemini: *S2 is closer to a playable and CR-appropriate 5e legendary/mythic boss (more reasonable DCs/HP/action economy and cleaner formatting), whereas S1’s extremely high DC 25, massive effective hit points, and stacked save/defense riders make it overtuned and less balanced at CR 25.*
- claude_claude_claude vs claude_gemini_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gemini_gpt: *S1 uses modern simplified spellcasting that's easier to run, has a dramatically superior mythic trait implementation (Doombot Protocol with explosion and resource refresh), more complete ability descriptions (Molecular Expander specifies half damage on save), and higher lair action DCs (20 vs 18), making it both more balanced and more thematically satisfying as a climactic villain encounter.*
  - GPT picked claude_claude_claude: *S2 hews closer to CR 25 math and 5e conventions by limiting major defenses/offenses with per-day/slot gates (rather than S1’s effectively CR-inflating mythic extra HP plus near-unlimited +5 reaction), while still delivering Doom’s tech-mage theme with cleaner, more playable action economy.*
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gemini_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 offers better CR 25 accuracy without an overtuned mythic phase, uses more modern 5e design conventions (bonus actions, limited-use reactions), provides DM flexibility with the optional Doombot Contingency, maintains consistent save DCs across lair actions, and delivers a more manageable encounter complexity while still capturing Doctor Doom's thematic essence.*
  - GPT: *S2 is more mechanically balanced and playable for a CR 25 (bounded defenses, limited-use reactions/mitigation, clearer Doom Armor math, and less swingy/over-tanky mythic scaling) while still strongly representing Doom’s tech-magic mastery in clean 5e formatting.*
- claude_gpt_gpt vs gpt_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gpt_gpt: *S2 better captures Doctor Doom thematically with essential Doombot mechanics (including a full statblock), the brilliant Doombot Contingency decoy feature, and properly emphasizing his supreme intellect (INT 28), while using more modern 5e formatting with proper Bonus Actions/Reactions sections and providing immediately playable ancillary creature stats.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gpt: *S1 is closer to CR 25 math with more reasonable save DCs/attack bonuses and a tighter, more runnable kit (mythic phase, clear technomystic theming, and cleaner 5e formatting), whereas S2’s extreme DC 25 spellcasting with swingy effects (e.g., power word kill) and extra minion/feature overhead pushes it toward higher-than-25 lethality and slower play.*
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat claude_gpt_gemini (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 has more accurate CR 25 balance with appropriate DC 23 saves (versus S2's overly high DC 25), uses modern streamlined spellcasting without slot tracking, and offers cleaner playability while still capturing Doom's techno-sorcery through features like Master of Machines and Unibeam—though S2's Doombot inclusion is thematically excellent, its inflated save DCs would make the encounter play harder than CR 25 suggests.*
  - GPT: *S1 better matches CR 25 expectations with clearer, more consistent 5e monster formatting and action economy (including mythic/legendary pacing), while S2’s extreme DC/ability scores and swingy stun/disadvantage mechanics skew balance and make its spellcasting/slot structure and added Doombot elements less clean to run.*
- **gpt_claude_gemini** beat claude_claude_claude (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 uses modern simplified spellcasting that's easier to run and better balanced, maintains consistent save DCs throughout (DC 23), and has a well-designed mythic trait, while S2 suffers from inconsistent lair action DCs (DC 18 vs creature DC 25), unwieldy 18th-level slot-based casting that creates decision paralysis, and unclear AC calculation from its armor description.*
  - GPT: *S1 is the stronger 5e monster design overall, with more consistent DCs/bonuses, curated actions and spell options that play smoothly at the table, and a coherent mythic/legendary/lair package, whereas S2’s sprawling full-wizard spell list, very high DC 25 math, and inconsistent lair DCs make its CR 25 balance and playability less reliable.*
- gpt_claude_gemini vs gpt_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked gpt_claude_gemini: *S2 follows modern 5e formatting conventions more closely with a proper Bonus Actions section, explicitly organized reactions (including Reactionary Spell and separated Armor Reinforcement), and clearer cantrip placement in legendary actions, while also better representing Doom's genius with INT 24 and maintaining cleaner playability through streamlined spell options.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gpt: *S1 is better balanced and more rules-faithful (costly-component spellcasting wording, clearer legendary/mythic action economy without stacking an extra mythic-action pool, and cleaner spell/legendary options), while still presenting Doom’s technomystic theme and CR 25 playability more accurately than S2.*
- claude_gpt_claude vs claude_gpt_gemini: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_gpt_claude: *S2's 'Arrogant Monologue' feature brilliantly captures Doom's ego as a mechanical weakness, uses modern 5e innate spellcasting format, has more thematically appropriate spells (time stop, dominate monster), includes proper mythic XP notation, and features cleaner action economy with better-defined mechanics like Electroshock's success clause.*
  - GPT picked claude_gpt_gemini: *S1 is more playable and rules-faithful (notably handling counterspell/shield via reactions), has tighter encounter balance with capped Doombot summoning and a thematic Doombot-reveal mythic phase, and avoids S2’s potentially runaway minion economy and awkward spell/legendary-action timing.*
- claude_claude_gpt vs claude_gpt_gemini: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_claude_gpt: *S2 has superior 5e formatting with critical clarifications ('can take only one reaction per round'), balancing limitations on Supreme Intellect (1-minute cooldown per creature), and the full spell slot system with Time Stop and Power Word Kill better represents Doom's canonical mastery of sorcery, while the Investigation check to detect the Doombot decoy adds clever thematic depth.*
  - GPT picked claude_gpt_gemini: *S1 is more playable and thematically coherent (mind-reading immunity, Doombot mythic reveal, tighter spell list), avoids S2’s mechanical bugs (Indomitable Will rarely triggers due to charm/fear immunity) and under-tuned lair DCs, and its defenses/offense track CR 25 more cleanly without S2’s swingy “resistance to all damage” and Doombot swarm bloat.*
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat claude_gpt_gemini (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 uses CR-appropriate save DCs (DC 22 vs S2's excessive DC 25), maintains consistent 5e formatting throughout, and balances offensive power without the problematic combinations in S2 (Supreme Intellect granting disadvantage against already-high DCs, plus a 3-action stunning legendary action).*
  - GPT: *S1 is closer to CR 25 expectations (DC/attack bonuses, durability, and damage pacing), uses cleaner 5e monster formatting with cohesive technomystic theming, and avoids S2’s overtuned DC 25/+17 accuracy and save-disadvantage combo that can make play swingy and unfun.*
- gpt_claude_gemini vs claude_claude_gpt: **DRAW** (1-1)
  - Claude picked claude_claude_gpt: *S2 better captures Doctor Doom's identity with the iconic Doombot Contingency mechanic, full 18th-level spellcasting befitting Marvel's premier sorcerer-scientist, and includes a complete Doombot statblock making it a ready-to-run encounter package.*
  - GPT picked gpt_claude_gemini: *S1 is more playable and consistently formatted as a 5e monster (concise spell suite, clear recharge/legendary/mythic structure, coherent DCs), while S2’s inflated save DC/attack math, “all languages,” inconsistent lair DCs, and extra Doombot/slot complexity make its CR 25 balance and table usability weaker.*
- **gpt_claude_gpt** beat claude_claude_gpt (2-0)
  - Claude: *S1 demonstrates superior CR 25 accuracy with appropriate DC 22 saves and balanced damage output, uses modern streamlined spellcasting format, and features a well-implemented mythic trait, while S2's DC 25 saves throughout and combination of full 18th-level spellcasting with numerous powerful abilities (especially the 3-action stun) pushes it beyond its stated CR.*
  - GPT: *S1 hews closer to 5e monster design with bounded attack/DC numbers, streamlined spellcasting and action options that are easier to run, and its Doom theme (technomagic tyrant with a mythic phase) lands without S2’s inflated DC 25/ability scores, inconsistent lair DCs, and extra minion/spell-slot complexity that can skew CR balance and playability.*
- **claude_gpt_gpt** beat claude_gpt_gemini (2-0)
  - Claude: *S2 has cleaner 5e formatting, a more balanced Supreme Intellect (disadvantage on first save only vs all saves), better organized spellcasting with a more thematically complete spell list, streamlined reactions without redundancy, and the optional Doombot Contingency improves playability by letting DMs scale complexity.*
  - GPT: *S2 is more mechanically bounded and CR-consistent (notably avoiding S1’s effectively unlimited shield/counterspell and bonus-action/legendary-action stacking), while also presenting clearer 5e formatting and more playable, internally consistent resource limits for a Doom boss fight.*
