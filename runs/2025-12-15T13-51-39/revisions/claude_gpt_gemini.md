***Armor of Doom.*** Doom's armor grants him immunity to disease and the need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. The armor generally cannot be removed against his will.
*   **Regeneration.** Doom regains 15 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ruler of Latveria.*** Doom has advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with creatures that recognize his authority. Insight checks made against him are made with disadvantage.

***Supreme Sorcerer.*** Doom's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield*
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, misty step*
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, fire shield*
5th level (3 slots): *telekinesis, wall of force*
6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, teleport*
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, maze*
9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Plasma Bolt, or a combination of the two. He can replace one attack with a casting of a cantrip.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage. The first time Doom hits a creature with this attack on his turn, the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d8 + 9) force damage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.

***Disintegrator Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom fires a beam of destructive energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying.

***Summon Elite Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 2 **Elite Doombots**. They appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of Doom, act on their own initiative, and obey his commands. They function as **Helmed Horrors** with the following changes:
*   **AC** 20 (plate armor, shield)
*   **Intelligence** 14
*   **Action:** *Plasma Blast.* Ranged Spell Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) force damage.

### Bonus Actions

***Personal Force Field (3/Day).*** Doom activates a localized energy shield, gaining 60 temporary hit points. While these temporary hit points remain, Doom has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Deflection Matrix.*** When Doom is hit by a ranged attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he can use his reaction to deflect it. He takes no damage from *magic missile* and reduces the damage from a ranged attack by 30 (1d10 + 25). If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can redirect the attack at a creature within 60 feet, using the original attack roll against the new target.

***Superior Counterspell (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see casts a spell of 5th level or lower, he can use his reaction to negate the spell (no ability check required).

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or uses *detect magic*.
**Plasma Bolt (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Bolt attack.
**Technomantic Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom causes one technological or metal object he can see within 60 feet to malfunction. If a creature is wearing or holding the object, it must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage and drop the object. Constructs and creatures in heavy armor have disadvantage on this save.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Concealed turrets target up to three creatures Doom can see. Each target must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) force damage.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors within the lair magically seal until initiative count 20 of the next round. A sealed door can be forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength check or destroyed (AC 18, 50 HP, immunity to poison and psychic damage).
- **Neural Scrambler.** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of a technological device. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Intelligence saving throw or be incapacitated until initiative count 20 of the next round.
- **Teleportation Grid.** Doom and up to five willing creatures he can see within 120 feet each teleport to an unoccupied space of Doom's choice within the lair.
