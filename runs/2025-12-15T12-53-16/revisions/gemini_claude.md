# gemini's Statblock (revised by claude)

Here is the revised statblock for **Doctor Doom**.

This revision incorporates the feedback to ensure the mechanics adhere to 5th Edition standards, corrects the action economy balance issues (specifically regarding reaction spam and infinite healing), and clarifies complex features while retaining the "campaign ender" feel.

**Scientific Sorcery.** Doom’s armor and magic are intertwined. He ignores the verbal and somatic components of spells. Additionally, his spellcasting and magical items cannot be suppressed by an *antimagic field* unless the field is generated by a deity or an artifact, or the field also suppresses technological items.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Indomitable Ego.** Doom has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against effects that are not spells or magical effects.

**The Doombot Protocol.** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, roll a d20. On a roll of 11 or higher, the body sparks and explodes in a 20-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The true Doom reveals himself to have been watching from afar, or teleports to a space within 300 feet (DM's discretion), with half his hit points remaining.
*   **Counter-measures:** This trait does not function if Doom is incapacitated, stunned, or paralyzed when he drops to 0 hit points. Additionally, if *dispel magic* was successfully cast on Doom using a spell slot of 7th level or higher within the last minute, the protocol fails and Doom dies normally.

***

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two Arcane Gauntlet attacks. He can substitute one attack for a use of Spellcasting (cantrip or 3rd-level *lightning bolt* only).

**Arcane Gauntlet.** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone.

**Molecular Disruption (Recharge 5–6).** Doom emits a wave of destabilizing energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) necrotic damage and is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't paralyzed.

**Spellcasting.** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (Spell Save DC 25, +17 to hit with spell attacks):
*   **At will:** *detect magic, mage hand, misty step, shield, lightning bolt* (3rd level)
*   **3/day each:** *counterspell, disintegrate, telekinesis, wall of force, lightning bolt* (5th level)
*   **1/day each:** *power word stun, plane shift, time stop, meteor swarm*

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons two **Doombots** to unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. Use *Helmed Horror* statistics, but with a fly speed of 60 ft. and the ability to cast *eldritch blast* (2 beams, +8 to hit). They obey his verbal commands and act immediately after his turn.

***

### Reactions

**Techno-Magical Absorption (Recharge 5–6).** When Doom is targeted by a spell that deals damage or includes a magical energy attack (such as a dragon's breath weapon), he activates his armor's siphon. He takes no damage from the attack and regains hit points equal to half the damage rolled.

***

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

*   **Tactical Reposition.** Doom moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
*   **Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet attack.
*   **Kneel Before Doom (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom projects a pulse of gravitational dominance. Each enemy within 30 feet of Doom must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or fall prone. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
*   **Absolute Power (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom recharges his *Molecular Disruption* ability.

***

## Lair Actions (Castle Doom)
On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Doom can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1.  **Defense Grid.** Concealed turrets emerge from the walls. Each creature of Doom's choice in the lair must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
2.  **Latverian Technology.** A 30-foot cube centered on a point Doom can see becomes affected as if by an *antimagic field* until initiative count 20 on the next round. Due to his Scientific Sorcery trait, Doom's spells and abilities function normally within this area, though other magical items do not.
3.  **Diplomatic Immunity.** Doom designates one creature he can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be unable to target Doom directly with attacks or harmful spells until initiative count 20 on the next round. The creature can still include Doom in an area of effect (such as a *fireball*).

## Designer Notes: Changes Made

Based on the feedback review, the following adjustments were implemented:

1.  **Limited Immunity:** *Techno-Magical Absorption* changed from At-Will to **Recharge 5-6**. This prevents infinite healing/immunity while keeping it a potent threat that forces players to bait the reaction.
2.  **Spellcasting Balance:**
    *   *Counterspell* moved from At-Will to **3/Day**. This restores agency to player casters.
    *   *Lightning Bolt* split: At-Will version is now 3rd level; 5th level version is limited.
3.  **Action Economy:** *Absolute Power* no longer recovers spell slots (preventing infinite *Wall of Force* loops), only his breath weapon equivalent.
4.  **Rules Compliance:**
    *   *Kneel Before Doom* changed from "end turn" (non-standard) to **Prone + Conditional Stun** (standard mechanics).
    *   *Indomitable Ego* changed to apply to **non-magical** effects to strictly avoid stacking with Magic Resistance.
    *   *Doombot Protocol* counter-play clarified (Dispel Magic lowered to 7th level, conditions added).
5.  **Lair Actions:** Added specific Damage Die and DC numbers where they were missing.
