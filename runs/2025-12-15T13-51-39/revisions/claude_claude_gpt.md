***Armor of Doom.*** Doom’s armor grants him immunity to disease, and he doesn’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. The armor can’t be removed against his will. At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he regains 10 hit points.

***Indomitable Will.*** Doom is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically determine whether he is lying (such as *detect thoughts* or *zone of truth*).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ruler of Latveria.*** Doom has advantage on Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against creatures that recognize his authority or political power.

***Supreme Sorcerer.*** Doom’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He can cast *shield* at will.  
Doom can concentrate on two spells at the same time, provided one of the spells is 4th level or lower. If he must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, he makes a separate saving throw for each spell he’s concentrating on.

Doom has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*  
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile*  
2nd level (3 slots): *hold person, mirror image, misty step*  
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*  
4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, fire shield*  
5th level (3 slots): *hold monster, telekinesis, wall of force*  
6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, plane shift, teleport*  
8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster, power word stun*  
9th level (1 slot): *power word kill, time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using Gauntlet Strike, Plasma Bolt, or a combination of the two. He can replace one attack with a casting of a cantrip.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage. The first creature Doom hits with this attack on each of his turns must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the start of Doom’s next turn.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (5d8 + 7) force damage plus 13 (3d8) fire damage.

***Disintegrator Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom fires a beam of destructive energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons two **Doombots** in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet of him. Roll initiative for the Doombots as a group; they take their turns on that initiative count and obey Doom’s commands. The Doombots vanish after 1 hour or when destroyed.

A Doombot uses the **animated armor** stat block, with the following changes: AC 18; HP 52; Intelligence 14; it speaks all languages Doom speaks; and it can cast *fire bolt* at will (spell attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., *Hit:* 11 (2d10) fire damage).

### Bonus Actions

***Personal Force Field (3/Day).*** Doom gains 40 temporary hit points for 1 minute. While he has any of these temporary hit points, he has resistance to force damage and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from magical attacks.

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

### Reactions

***Deflection Matrix.*** When Doom is hit by a ranged attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he can use his reaction to deflect it. He takes no damage from *magic missile* and reduces the damage from a ranged attack by 35 (10d6). If this reduces the damage to 0, Doom can redirect the attack at a creature within 60 feet of him, using the original attack roll against the new target.

***Superior Counterspell (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see casts a spell of 3rd level or lower, Doom can use his reaction to automatically counter the spell, requiring no ability check and expending no spell slot.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Detect.** Doom makes a Wisdom (Perception) check or casts *detect magic*.

**Plasma Bolt (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one Plasma Bolt attack.

**Technomantic Assault (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom targets one technological device, suit of metal armor, or metal weapon he can see within 60 feet. If the object is worn or held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) lightning damage and drop the object (if possible). Constructs and creatures wearing heavy armor have disadvantage on this saving throw.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his list of prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

___

### Lair Actions

When fighting inside Castle Doom or another location he has prepared, Doom can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one of the following lair actions; he can’t take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Automated Defenses.** Concealed turrets target up to three creatures Doom can see. Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) force damage.

- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors within the lair magically seal until initiative count 20 of the next round. A sealed door can be forced open with a successful DC 23 Strength check or destroyed (AC 18, 50 HP, immunity to poison and psychic damage).

- **Neural Scrambler.** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 of the next round.

- **Teleportation Grid.** Doom and up to five willing creatures he can see within 120 feet each teleport to unoccupied spaces of Doom’s choice within the lair.

> ### Doombot Deception
> *At the DM’s discretion, any encounter with Doctor Doom may actually be a Doombot duplicate in disguise. When a “Doom” is reduced to 0 hit points, there is a chance (determined by the DM) that it is revealed to be a Doombot, exploding for 28 (8d6) fire damage to all creatures within 15 feet (DC 18 Dexterity save for half). The real Doom observes from a safe location, gaining intelligence on his foes.*
