___

***Doom Armor.*** Doom's armor grants the following benefits: his AC includes his Intelligence modifier, he can breathe in any environment including vacuum, he is immune to disease, and he has advantage on saving throws against effects that would move him against his will.

***Doombot Decoy (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Long Rest).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, his form is revealed as a Doombot, which explodes. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The true Doctor Doom then teleports to an unoccupied space within 120 feet with 300 hit points, his expended uses of Legendary Resistance restored, and his Doom Blast recharged.

*If the Doombot Decoy activates, Doom can use the options in the "Mythic Actions" section for 1 hour. Award a party 150,000 XP (75,000 XP per phase) for defeating Doctor Doom after his Doombot Decoy activates.*

***Indomitable Will.*** If Doom succeeds on a saving throw against being charmed, frightened, or having his mind read or controlled, the creature that forced the save takes 14 (4d6) psychic damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 25):

At will: *detect magic, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation*
3/day each: *counterspell, dispel magic, greater invisibility, mirror image, wall of force*
2/day each: *forcecage, globe of invulnerability, telekinesis*
1/day each: *dominate monster, plane shift, power word kill, teleport, time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks using any combination of Gauntlet Strike and Plasma Bolt.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) lightning damage.

***Plasma Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +17 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (4d10 + 9) force damage.

***Doom Blast (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a 90-foot cone of arcane devastation. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 81 (18d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Molecular Expander (1/Day).*** Doom targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 55 (10d10) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

***Summon Doombots (1/Day).*** Doom summons 2 **Doombots** in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet. They act on his initiative, obey his commands, and last for 1 hour or until destroyed.

### Bonus Actions

***Energy Shield (3/Day).*** Doom gains resistance to all damage until the start of his next turn.

### Reactions

***Technomagical Shield.*** When Doom is hit by an attack or forced to make a saving throw, he can add +5 to his AC against that attack or +5 to the saving throw, potentially causing the attack to miss or the save to succeed.

***Retributive Strike.*** When a creature within 60 feet damages Doom, he forces it to make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failure, or half on a success.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Analyze.** Doom analyzes a creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the end of Doom's next turn, he has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Doom's spells and abilities.
**Tactical Teleport.** Doom teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
**Plasma Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Plasma Bolt attacks.
**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 5th level or lower from his Spellcasting trait.
**Electroshock (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) lightning damage and be stunned until the end of its next turn. A successful save halves the damage with no stun.

### Mythic Actions

If Doom's Doombot Decoy trait has activated, he can use the options below as legendary actions.

**Overwhelming Force (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom uses Doom Blast if available, or makes a Gauntlet Strike attack against each creature within 5 feet.
**Arcane Supremacy (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *power word kill*, *forcecage*, or *dominate monster* if available, without expending a daily use.

## LAIR ACTIONS

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Doom can take a lair action while in Castle Doom to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Activate Doombots.** Two **Doombots** emerge from hidden alcoves within 60 feet of Doom.
- **Arcane Turrets.** Up to three creatures Doom can see must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) force damage on a failure, or half on a success.
- **Lockdown Protocol.** All doors and passages seal shut (AC 18, 100 HP, damage threshold 15, immune to poison and psychic damage). Doom can open any sealed door at will.
- **Neural Disruptor.** A 30-foot-radius sphere appears centered on a point within 120 feet. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until initiative count 20 of the next round.
