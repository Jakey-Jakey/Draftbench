### Traits

**Doom Armor.** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. His weapon attacks are magical.

**Force Field Matrix.** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he gains 30 temporary hit points. If he already has temporary hit points, he replaces them with 30 temporary hit points.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Master of Magic and Machine.** When Doom casts a spell that deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, or force damage, he can change that damage type to another type from that list.

**Mastermind’s Preparedness.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

**Spellcasting.** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). Doom requires no material components to cast his spells.  
*Arcane blast* is a Doom-only cantrip that is identical to *eldritch blast*, except it uses Intelligence for its spellcasting ability.

- **Cantrips (at will):** *arcane blast, mage hand, mending, minor illusion, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp*  
- **1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, magic missile, shield*  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *hold person, invisibility, mirror image, misty step*  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, lightning bolt*  
- **4th level (3 slots):** *banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility*  
- **5th level (3 slots):** *bigby’s hand, steel wind strike, wall of force*  
- **6th level (2 slots):** *disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*  
- **7th level (2 slots):** *forcecage, plane shift*

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes two attacks, using Doomfist or Gauntlet Blast in any combination.

**Doomfist.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Gauntlet Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) force damage. If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**Arcane Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom releases a surging wave of technomagical force in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

**Summon Doombots (1/Day).** Doom summons 2 Doombots in unoccupied spaces he can see within 60 feet. Each Doombot uses the **helmed horror** stat block, except it has 30 hit points and it doesn’t have the **Spell Immunity** trait. The Doombots act on Doom’s initiative (immediately after his turn) and obey his telepathic commands. A Doombot vanishes after 1 hour, when Doom is incapacitated, or when Doom dismisses it (no action).

---

### Reactions

**Redirective Shielding.** When Doom takes damage from an attack made by a creature he can see within 60 feet, he halves the damage he takes from that attack (round down). The attacker then takes lightning damage equal to the damage Doom took (maximum 20 lightning damage).

**Warp Step.** Doom magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.
