***Integrated Combat Systems.*** Doom uses his Intelligence modifier in place of Strength for attack and damage rolls with his gauntlet weapons.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mastermind's Intellect.*** Doom adds his Intelligence modifier to his initiative rolls.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 20 temporary hit points. This ability is suppressed until the start of Doom's next turn if he takes a critical hit or is targeted by a successful *dispel magic* (DC 18).

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom's attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom's suit allows him to understand and speak all languages.

---

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks: one with his Gauntlet Strike and two with his Repulsor Blast. He can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

***Electro-Shock (Recharge 5–6).*** Immediately after Doom hits a creature with his Gauntlet Strike, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of Doom's next turn.

***Repulsor Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d10) force damage.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing a wave of gravitic force. Each creature within 60 feet of Doom must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Doom's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23):

* At will: *detect magic*, *mage hand*, *message*, *prestidigitation*, *shocking grasp*
* 3/day each: *dispel magic*, *fly*, *lightning bolt*, *misty step*
* 2/day each: *banishment*, *chain lightning*, *dimension door*, *telekinesis*, *wall of force*
* 1/day each: *disintegrate*, *forcecage*, *plane shift*, *power word stun*, *time stop*

### Bonus Actions

***Tactical Analysis.*** Doom studies one creature he can see within 60 feet. Until the end of Doom's next turn, he has advantage on attack rolls against that creature and the target has disadvantage on saving throws against his spells.

---

### Reactions

***Arcane Deflection (3/Day).*** When Doom is targeted by a spell, he attempts to interrupt it. He casts *counterspell* at 5th level.

***Shield (3/Day).*** When Doom is hit by an attack or targeted by *magic missile*, he casts *shield*, gaining +5 AC until the start of his next turn, including against the triggering attack.

---

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Relocation.** Doom teleports to an unoccupied space he can see within 60 feet.

**Repulsor Barrage (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes two Repulsor Blast attacks.

**Arcane Surge (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *lightning bolt*, *chain lightning*, *misty step*, or *dimension door*, expending a daily use as normal.

---

### Mythic Trait

***Doombot Decoy (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, he doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, his current form is revealed to be an advanced Doombot construct, which detonates. Each creature within 20 feet of the Doombot must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

The real Doctor Doom then appears in an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet. He has 142 hit points, regains all expended uses of Legendary Resistance, and gains access to his mythic actions. Award a party an additional 13,000 XP (75,000 XP total) for defeating Doctor Doom after his Doombot Decoy activates.

---

### Mythic Actions

If Doom's Doombot Decoy trait has activated, he can use the options below as legendary actions for 1 hour after it activates.

**Deploy Doombot.** Doom summons a Doombot in an unoccupied space within 30 feet. Use the **helmed horror** stat block with the following changes: its attacks deal an additional 4 (1d8) lightning damage, and it has immunity to lightning damage instead of immunity to three spells.

**Overcharge Systems (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom overloads his suit's weapons. The next Repulsor Blast attack he makes before the end of his next turn deals an additional 22 (4d10) force damage on a hit.

**Masterplan Revealed (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts *telekinesis*, *wall of force*, or *banishment*, expending a daily use as normal.
