### Traits

**Arcane Power Armor.** Doom can’t be disarmed of his armor. While wearing it, he has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration, and he ignores the somatic component of spells he casts.

**Genius Tactician.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised while conscious.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Sovereign’s Presence.** Creatures of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him that can see or hear him have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes three attacks in any combination using his **Armored Gauntlet** and **Repulsor Beam**, or he casts a spell and makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.

**Armored Gauntlet.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (1d10 + 6 plus 2d6) bludgeoning and lightning damage.  
**Gravitic Impact (1/Turn).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet (Doom’s choice).

**Repulsor Beam.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) force damage.

**Technomystic Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom unleashes a devastating surge of hexed energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails is also **pushed 20 feet** away from Doom and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Mystic Shackles (Recharge 6).** Doom targets up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 27 (6d8) force damage and become **restrained** for 1 minute. A restrained target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Reactions

**Arcane Countermeasures (3/Day).** When Doom is hit by an attack or fails a saving throw, he can use his reaction to gain one of the following benefits:
- **Deflecting Field:** Doom gains a +5 bonus to AC against that attack (including the triggering attack).  
- **Stabilizing Runes:** Doom gains a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

**Dread Rebuke.** When a creature within 30 feet hits Doom with an attack, Doom can cast **shocking grasp** at that creature (no spell slot required). If the attack hits, the target also can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

---

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Cantrip.** Doom casts a cantrip.  

**Gauntlet Strike.** Doom makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.  

**Repulsor Shot (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one **Repulsor Beam** attack.  

**Imperious Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet that can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to this Doom’s Imperious Command for 24 hours.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

---

## Optional: Lair Actions (Castle Doom)
When fighting inside his seat of power, Doom can invoke lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action below; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Seal the Chamber.** Arcane-metal doors slam shut. Up to three openings Doom can see within 120 feet become sealed by reinforced barriers (AC 19; 40 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic).  
2. **Doombot Interdiction.** Up to two constructs (doombots, suits of armor, or similar guardians) appear in unoccupied spaces Doom can see within 60 feet. Each acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order and lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed.  
3. **Null-Mystic Surge.** Each enemy spellcaster of Doom’s choice within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on concentration checks and can’t cast spells using reactions (such as *counterspell*) until initiative count 20 on the next round.

If you tell me the party level/composition and whether the fight is meant to be “fair” or a near-TPK set piece, I can tune Doom’s spell list, damage output, and lair to fit your table’s power level.
