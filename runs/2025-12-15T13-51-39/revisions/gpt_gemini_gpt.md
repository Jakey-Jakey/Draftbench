***Arcane Power Armor.*** Doom’s armor can’t be removed against his will. While he wears it, Doom has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and he can’t be disarmed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Arcane Stabilizers.*** Doom has advantage on Constitution saving throws he makes to maintain concentration on a spell.

***Dual Concentration Matrix.*** Doom can concentrate on two spells at once. If Doom fails a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, he loses concentration on both spells.

***Paradox Reflexes.*** Doom can take one reaction on every turn in combat, rather than only one reaction per round.

***Spell Turning.*** When Doom succeeds on a saving throw against a spell that targets only him (not an area effect), he can choose another creature (other than the spell’s caster) he can see within 30 feet of him. That creature becomes the spell’s target instead. If the spell required an attack roll, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature. If the spell forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own saving throw against the spell.

***Tactical Genius.*** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp  
- **1st level (4 slots):** absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile, shield  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** hold person, mirror image, misty step  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** counterspell, dispel magic, lightning bolt  
- **4th level (3 slots):** dimension door, greater invisibility, stoneskin  
- **5th level (3 slots):** dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force  
- **6th level (2 slots):** disintegrate, globe of invulnerability  
- **7th level (2 slots):** forcecage, plane shift  
- **8th level (1 slot):** dominate monster  
- **9th level (1 slot):** time stop  

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two attacks with his Doomfist Strike or Arcane Gauntlet Blast. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Doomfist Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or it can’t take reactions and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet directly away from Doom and knocked prone.

***Mystic-Scientific Beam (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom unleashes a devastating fusion of sorcery and high-energy tech in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Objects and structures in the line take double damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Tactical Teleport.*** Doom magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

## Reactions

***Counterspell Protocol (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet of him casts a spell, Doom casts *counterspell* at 5th level, requiring no material components.

## Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Cantrip.*** Doom casts a cantrip.

***Commanding Step.*** Doom moves up to half his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Doomfist.*** Doom makes one Doomfist Strike attack.

***Arcane Gauntlet.*** Doom makes one Arcane Gauntlet Blast attack.
