### Traits

**Arcane Power Armor.** Doom can’t be disarmed of his armor. While wearing it, he has advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration, and he ignores the somatic component of spells he casts.  
In addition, Doom uses Intelligence instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls with his **Armored Gauntlet**.

**Genius Tactician.** Doom has advantage on initiative rolls, and he can’t be surprised while conscious.

**Magic Resistance.** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Sovereign’s Presence.** Creatures of Doom’s choice within 30 feet of him that can see or hear him have disadvantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**Beneath Doom’s Notice (1/Day).** When Doom is reduced to half his hit point maximum or fewer for the first time, he regains one expended use of Legendary Resistance.

### Spellcasting
Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save **DC 21**, **+13** to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components for spells unless they have a listed gold cost or consume a component.

He has the following spells prepared:

- **Cantrips (at will):** fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost, shocking grasp  
- **1st level (4 slots):** absorb elements, detect magic, magic missile, shield  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** hold person, mirror image, misty step  
- **3rd level (3 slots):** counterspell, fireball, lightning bolt  
- **4th level (3 slots):** banishment, dimension door, greater invisibility  
- **5th level (3 slots):** dominate person, telekinesis, wall of force  
- **6th level (2 slots):** disintegrate, globe of invulnerability  
- **7th level (2 slots):** reverse gravity, teleport  
- **8th level (1 slot):** mind blank  
- **9th level (1 slot):** time stop  

**Doom’s Time Stop (Limitation).** When Doom casts *time stop*, the spell ends early if he casts a spell that creates a barrier or prison meant to confine creatures (such as *wall of force*).

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Doom makes three attacks in any combination using his **Armored Gauntlet** and **Repulsor Beam**, or he casts a spell and makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.

**Armored Gauntlet.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.  
**Gravitic Impact (1/Turn).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone or pushed up to 10 feet (Doom’s choice).

**Repulsor Beam.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (6d10) force damage.

**Technomystic Pulse (Recharge 5–6).** Doom unleashes a surge of hexed energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails is also pushed 20 feet away from Doom and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Mystic Shackles (Recharge 6).** Doom targets up to two creatures he can see within 60 feet. Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 27 (6d8) force damage and become restrained for 1 minute. A restrained target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

---

### Reactions

**Arcane Countermeasures (3/Day).** When Doom is hit by an attack or when he makes a saving throw, he can use his reaction to gain one of the following benefits:
- **Deflecting Field:** Doom gains a +5 bonus to AC until the start of his next turn, including against the triggering attack.  
- **Stabilizing Runes:** Doom adds +4 to the triggering saving throw.

**Dread Rebuke.** When a creature within 30 feet of Doom hits him with an attack, Doom casts **shocking grasp** at that creature as part of this reaction, ignoring the spell’s normal range (no spell slot required). On a hit, the target suffers the spell’s normal effects, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.

---

### Legendary Actions
Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Cantrip.** Doom casts a cantrip.  

**Gauntlet Strike.** Doom makes one **Armored Gauntlet** attack.  

**Repulsor Shot (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom makes one **Repulsor Beam** attack.  

**Imperious Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature of Doom’s choice within 30 feet that can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to **Doom’s Imperious Command** for 24 hours.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom casts a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower that has a casting time of **1 action**.

---

## Optional: Lair Actions (Castle Doom)
When fighting inside his seat of power, Doom can invoke lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Doom can take one lair action below; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

1. **Seal the Chamber.** Arcane-metal doors slam shut. Up to three openings Doom can see within 120 feet become sealed by reinforced barriers (AC 19; 40 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic).  
2. **Doombot Interdiction.** Up to two **doombots** appear in unoccupied spaces Doom can see within 60 feet (see the doombot stat block below). Each doombot acts immediately after Doom in the initiative order and lasts for 1 minute or until destroyed.  
3. **Null-Mystic Surge.** Each enemy spellcaster of Doom’s choice within 120 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on concentration checks and can’t cast spells using reactions (such as *counterspell*) until initiative count 20 on the next round.
