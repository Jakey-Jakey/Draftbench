***Doombot Contingency (1/Day).*** When Doom drops to 0 hit points, he can instead drop to 1 hit point and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see, leaving behind an illusory duplicate that collapses.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Mind Blank.*** Doom is under the permanent effects of a *mind blank* spell. He is immune to psychic damage and any effect that would sense his emotions, read his thoughts, or magically determine his location.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of his turns, Doom gains 20 temporary hit points. While he has these temporary hit points, he has advantage on saving throws against being stunned.

***Scientific Sorcery.*** Doom ignores verbal and somatic components when casting spells. Additionally, when Doom casts a spell that requires concentration, he can choose to maintain concentration on a second spell of 3rd level or lower. If he takes damage while concentrating on two spells, he makes concentration saving throws with disadvantage, and on a failure, he loses concentration on both spells.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom understands all spoken and written languages.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). Doom has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, fly*
- 4th level (3 slots): *banishment, dimension door, polymorph*
- 5th level (3 slots): *scrying, telekinesis, wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, globe of invulnerability*
- 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, teleport*
- 8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster*
- 9th level (1 slot): *time stop*

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes two Gauntlet Blast attacks. He can replace one attack with casting a cantrip.

***Titanium Gauntlet.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) force damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked prone.

***Gauntlet Blast.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d6 + 8) force damage plus 10 (3d6) lightning damage.

***Doom Cannon (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom fires a devastating energy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) force damage and 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions

***Power Siphon (3/Day).*** When a creature Doom can see within 60 feet casts a spell, Doom can cast *counterspell* at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. If he successfully counters a spell of 4th level or higher, he regains one expended spell slot of up to 3rd level.

### Legendary Actions

Doom can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Doom regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Tactical Reposition.** Doom teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

**Gauntlet Blast.** Doom makes one Gauntlet Blast attack.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom casts a cantrip or a spell of 3rd level or lower from his list of prepared spells, expending a spell slot as normal.

**Kneel Before Doom (Costs 3 Actions).** Doom releases a pulse of gravitational and psychic energy. Each creature of Doom's choice within 30 feet must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 22 (4d10) psychic damage, is knocked prone, and is grappled (escape DC 23) until the start of Doom's next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or grappled.
