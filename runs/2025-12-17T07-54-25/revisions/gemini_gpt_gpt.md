***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Doom fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Doom has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Universal Translator.*** Doom can understand all spoken and written languages. In addition, he can communicate telepathically with any creature within 120 feet of him that understands at least one language.

***Battle Suit Targeting.*** Doom uses Intelligence for attack and damage rolls with his gauntlet and repulsor weapons.

***Personal Force Field.*** At the start of each of Doom’s turns, he gains 20 temporary hit points. If Doom took thunder damage since the start of his last turn, he doesn’t gain these temporary hit points this turn.

***Techno-Magical Supremacy.*** Doom’s attacks and effects ignore resistance to force and lightning damage.

***Stunning Capacitors (Recharge 5–6).*** When Doom hits a creature with **Gauntlet Strike**, he can force it to make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is **stunned** until the start of Doom’s next turn.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Doom makes three attacks, using **Gauntlet Strike** once and **Repulsor Bolt** twice. He can replace one attack with casting a spell.

***Gauntlet Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) lightning damage.

***Repulsor Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) force damage.

***Kneel Before Doom (Recharge 5–6).*** Doom slams his fist into the ground, unleashing crushing gravitic force. Each creature of Doom’s choice within 60 feet of him must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) force damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

***Frightful Presence (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Doom’s choice that is within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Doom’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** Doom is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He requires no material components to cast his spells.
- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand, mending, message, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *absorb elements, detect magic, identify, magic missile, thunderwave*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts, hold person, misty step, scorching ray, mirror image*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell, dispel magic, fly, lightning bolt*

## Reactions

## Mythic Trait (Optional)

***Doombot Contingency (Mythic Trait; 1/Day).*** When Doom is reduced to 0 hit points, his body ruptures in a violent detonation. Each creature within 20 feet of Doom must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then Doom reappears at the start of his next turn in an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet, with 150 hit points. All conditions on him end, and he regains all expended uses of **Legendary Resistance**.  
If this trait is used, award an additional 62,000 XP.

### Mythic Legendary Actions
If **Doombot Contingency** is active, Doom has the following additional legendary action options.

**Doombot Barrage.** Doom makes one **Repulsor Bolt** attack against up to three creatures he can see within range, making a separate attack roll for each target.  
**Iron Will Protocol (Costs 2 Actions).** Doom ends one spell or magical effect on himself of 5th level or lower.
